                "reasoning": "In the observation image, Cube A is placed closer to the edge of the board, while Cube B is placed farther from the edge. For the board to remain balanced, the heavier cube would need to be placed closer to the pivot point (triangular prism) to counteract its weight effectively. This positioning suggests that Cube A is heavier than Cube B."

Later, Cube A is placed on the opposite side, and the board tilts downward on the side where Cube A is placed. This indicates that Cube A is heavier than Cube B, as it causes a stronger tilt when placed on the board."
