                "reasoning": "The book is flat on the surface, making it difficult for the robotic arm to directly grasp it without an overhang. Creating an overhang by pushing the book to the table edge allows the robotic arm to slide its fingers underneath for a secure grasp and lift to the higher platform."

                "reasoning": "In the provided images, the book is already positioned on the lower platform with sufficient clearance around it. The robotic arm has successfully grasped the book in the second checkpoint image (step 000156), indicating that it is capable of directly lifting the book without requiring additional manipulation like creating an overhang or sliding fingers underneath. Therefore, the most efficient approach is to directly grasp the book and lift it up to the higher platform."

                "reasoning": "The book is already positioned on the lower platform, which provides sufficient clearance for the robotic arm to directly grasp it. There is no need to create an overhang or slide fingers underneath, as the book is accessible for lifting. The task can be completed by directly grasping the book and lifting it to the higher platform."

                "reasoning": "Based on the observations, the book is flat on the lower platform, making it difficult to directly grasp or slide fingers underneath without creating an overhang. The most effective method is to push the book to create an overhang at the table edge, which allows the robotic arm to grasp and lift it more easily to the higher platform."

There is no need to create an overhang or slide fingers underneath the book, as it is accessible for direct grasping and lifting to the higher platform."
