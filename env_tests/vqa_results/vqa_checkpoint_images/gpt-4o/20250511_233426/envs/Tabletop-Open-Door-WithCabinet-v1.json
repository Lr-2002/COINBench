                "reasoning": "The images show that the door has already been opened successfully without any obstruction or difficulty. The robotic arm has manipulated the door handle and opened the door fully, as evidenced by the final position of the door in the second observation. There are no visible challenges such as weight or obstruction from the cabinet door. Therefore, the door can be directly opened."

This creates a physical barrier that prevents the main door from being fully opened. Therefore, the main challenge in opening the door is the cabinet door being in the way."

                "reasoning": "The images show that the cabinet door is positioned in such a way that it obstructs the opening of the main door. The robotic arm's manipulation process involves dealing with this obstruction, making the cabinet door the main challenge in opening the door."
