Observing the images, the balls are close together and near the dustpan, making it feasible to push multiple balls at once using the robotic arm. This approach minimizes the number of individual actions required, making it more efficient than picking and placing each ball individually."

This approach minimizes the number of individual movements required and speeds up the process, as opposed to picking and placing each ball individually, which would take significantly more time."

Pushing multiple balls at once with the robotic arm is the most efficient method to move them into the dustpan quickly, as it minimizes the number of individual actions required compared to picking up and placing each ball individually."

This method is faster and more efficient than picking up and placing each ball individually, which would require more precise movements and time for each ball."

Pushing multiple balls at once with the arm is the most efficient method to complete the task quickly, as it minimizes the number of individual actions required compared to picking up and placing each ball individually."
