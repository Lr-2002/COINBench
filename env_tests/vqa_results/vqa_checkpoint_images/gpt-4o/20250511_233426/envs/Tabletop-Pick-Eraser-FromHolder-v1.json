The eraser cannot be directly grasped due to the obstruction caused by the holder's walls. At step 000267, the eraser is visible outside the holder, indicating that pouring out the contents of the holder is an effective way to retrieve the eraser. Therefore, the correct approach is to pour out the eraser from the holder."

Observations at steps 000267 and 000317 show the robotic arm interacting with the holder, but the eraser remains inside. To retrieve the eraser, the most effective method would be to pour it out from the holder, as direct picking is obstructed by the holder's design."
