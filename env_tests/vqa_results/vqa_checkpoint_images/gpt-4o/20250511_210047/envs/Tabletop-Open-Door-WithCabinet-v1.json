This creates a physical barrier, making it the main challenge in opening the door. The door is not too heavy to push (eliminating option A), and we cannot directly open the door without addressing the obstruction (eliminating option C)."

The robotic arm appears to have successfully interacted with the door, and the cabinet door is not obstructing the process.
