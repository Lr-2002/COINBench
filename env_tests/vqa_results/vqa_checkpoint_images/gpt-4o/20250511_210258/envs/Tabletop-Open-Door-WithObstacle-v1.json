                "reasoning": "The images show a blue rectangular object and a red circular object positioned directly in the path of the door's swing. These objects act as obstacles that would block the door from opening fully. The robotic arm appears capable of reaching the door, and there is no indication that the door is too heavy to be opened directly. Therefore, the main challenge in opening this door is the obstacle blocking its path."

                "reasoning": "From the images, it is clear that there is a blue and red object positioned directly in the path of the door's movement. This object acts as an obstacle, preventing the door from being fully opened. The robotic arm has successfully manipulated the door to partially open it, but the obstacle blocks further progress. Therefore, the main challenge in opening the door is the presence of this obstacle."
