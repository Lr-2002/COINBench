                "answer": "B",
                "reasoning": "The images show that the cabinet door is already unobstructed, and the robotic arm is positioned near the cabinet handle. There is no need to move any board or object away, as the cabinet door can be opened directly. Choosing option B is the most efficient way to complete the task."

            "response": {
                "answer": "B",
                "reasoning": "From the observations, the cabinet door is already accessible, and there is no obstruction in the way. The robotic arm successfully opened the cabinet door in the second checkpoint without needing to move any board or other object. Therefore, the efficient way to open the cabinet is to open it directly without any additional steps."

            "response": {
                "answer": "A",
                "reasoning": "In the provided images, it is evident that there is a white board obstructing the cabinet door's movement. At step 000183, the robotic arm moves the board away, and at step 000395, the cabinet door is successfully opened. This sequence demonstrates that moving the board away first is necessary for the cabinet door to open efficiently. Attempting to open the cabinet directly without removing the obstruction would likely result in failure or inefficiency."

            "answer": "A",
            "correct": true

            "response": {
                "answer": "A",
                "reasoning": "From the images, it is clear that there is a board placed in front of the cabinet door. In the first observation (step 000183), the cabinet door is partially open, but the board obstructs the full range of motion of the door. In the subsequent steps (000395 and 000417), the robot has managed to open the cabinet door, but the board's presence limits the efficiency of the task. The query image further confirms that the board is still in the way. Therefore, the most efficient way to open the cabinet would be to first move the board away to clear the obstruction, and then open the cabinet door fully without interference."
