Based on the images, the cube is currently not on the marker, but the marker is clearly visible and accessible. Moving the cube to the marker first establishes the base for the holder to be placed on top. Option B suggests moving the holder first, which is unnecessary and complicates the sequence, as the holder needs to be placed on the cube after it is positioned on the marker. Therefore, the best sequence is to move the cube to the marker first and then place the holder on top, as described in Option A."

Observing the images, the cube is initially separate from the marker, and the holder is already positioned on the marker. To complete the task efficiently, the cube should first be moved to the marker, aligning it with the holder's position. Afterward, the holder can be placed on top of the cube. This sequence ensures the task is completed logically and avoids unnecessary repositioning of the holder."

Based on the observations, the cube is initially separate from the marker, and the holder is already near the marker. The logical sequence is to move the cube to the marker first, as this establishes the base for the holder.

Based on the observations, the cube is small and lightweight, making it easier to move first to the marker. Once the cube is positioned correctly, the holder can then be placed on top of it. This sequence ensures that the cube is properly aligned with the marker before the holder is added, avoiding unnecessary repositioning or adjustments. Option B unnecessarily complicates the process by moving the holder first, which does not align with the task's logical flow."
