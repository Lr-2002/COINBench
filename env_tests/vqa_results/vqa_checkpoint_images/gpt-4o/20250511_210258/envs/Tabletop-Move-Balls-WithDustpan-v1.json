                "answer": "A",
                "reasoning": "The task involves moving multiple balls into the holder using a dustpan. The dustpan is designed to collect multiple objects in one sweeping motion, as seen in the images where several balls are already inside the dustpan. Using a single sweeping motion to collect all the balls at once is the most efficient strategy, as it minimizes the number of movements required and leverages the dustpan's capacity to hold multiple balls simultaneously. Moving the balls one by one would be unnecessarily time-consuming and inefficient."

                "reasoning": "The images show that the robot is using a dustpan to collect the balls. At step 000000, multiple balls are scattered, and by step 000044, several balls have already been collected into the dustpan. This indicates that the robot is capable of collecting multiple balls at once using a sweeping motion. This strategy is more efficient than moving the balls one by one, as it minimizes the number of actions required to complete the task."

                "reasoning": "The images show that the robot successfully collects multiple balls using the dustpan in a single sweeping motion. At step '000044', the dustpan is positioned near the balls, and by step '000194', all the balls are inside the dustpan. Finally, at step '000252', the balls are transferred into the holder. This demonstrates that collecting all balls at once with a single sweeping motion is an efficient strategy, as it minimizes the number of movements required and ensures all balls are gathered simultaneously."

                "reasoning": "The images show that the robot successfully collects multiple balls using the dustpan in a single sweeping motion. At step 000194, the dustpan contains all the balls, and by step 000252, the balls are transferred into the holder. This demonstrates that collecting all balls at once is efficient and avoids the need for repetitive actions. Moving the balls one by one (Option B) would be slower and less efficient, as the dustpan is designed to handle multiple objects simultaneously."
