                "reasoning": "The images show that the cube is positioned within a narrow T-shaped path. The stick is being used to push the cube along this path toward the target position. The narrowness of the path makes it difficult for the robotic arm to directly grasp or manipulate the cube, especially since the cube is small and fits snugly within the path. Therefore, the stick is necessary to move the cube effectively along the constrained space."

The cube is small and the path is confined, making it difficult for the robotic arm to directly grasp or manipulate the cube without the stick.

The stick is used to precisely push the cube through the narrow path, which would be difficult to achieve using the robotic arm directly due to the small size of the cube and the restricted space.
