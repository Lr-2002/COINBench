To retrieve the cube, the robot arm must first open the door to gain access to the cube. Attempting to reach for the cube without opening the door (Option A) would be impossible due to the physical obstruction. The sequence of actions observed in the checkpoint images also supports this reasoning, as the robot arm interacts with the door before moving toward the cube."

Observations at steps 000132, 000172, and 000199 demonstrate that the robot arm successfully retrieves the cube only after opening the door. In step 000132, the cube is visible behind the door. In step 000172, the robot arm opens the door and begins interacting with the cube. Finally, in step 000199, the robot arm places the cube on the marker. Therefore, the correct sequence to retrieve the cube is to open the door first and then pick the cube."
