Observing the images, the green cube is positioned on one side of the board, and the holder is on the opposite side. To balance the board, the weight of the balls in the holder must counteract the weight of the green cube. Based on the setup, it appears that 5 balls are required to achieve balance, as the holder is large enough to accommodate them and the board is shown balanced in the final image with 5 balls inside the holder."

The query image shows the setup with all six balls available, but the correct number of balls required to balance the pivot is determined experimentally.

At step 000237, the robotic arm places a third ball into the holder, and the board appears to be balanced.

At step 000265, three balls are in the holder, and the board appears to be balanced. This suggests that three balls are sufficient to balance the board. However, the query image shows the setup with no balls in the holder, and the question asks how many balls can make the pivot balance. Based on the observations, adding one more ball (making it four in total) would ensure balance, as the board is already balanced with three balls. Therefore, the answer is A: 4."

At step 000313, the robotic arm picks up a purple ball and prepares to place it in the holder. At step 000334, the purple ball is added to the holder, making the total number of balls in the holder four. The board appears balanced at this point, as the tilt is corrected.
