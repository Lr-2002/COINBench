                "reasoning": "In the observation image, the long board is balanced on the triangular prism, and Cube A is placed closer to the edge of the board compared to Cube B. Despite Cube A being farther from the triangular prism (fulcrum), the board remains balanced. This indicates that Cube A is heavier, as its weight compensates for the increased distance from the fulcrum, maintaining the balance."

                "reasoning": "In the images at step '000165', the robotic arm places Cube B on one side of the board, and the board tilts downward on that side. This indicates that Cube B is heavier than Cube A, as its weight causes the board to lose balance and tilt. Cube A does not appear to have been placed on the board, but its weight would not have caused the same effect as Cube B."

                "answer": "A",
                "reasoning": "In the images, the robotic arm places Cube B on one side of the board first, and the board tilts slightly downward on that side. Later, Cube A is placed on the opposite side, and the board tilts significantly downward on the side where Cube A is located. This indicates that Cube A is heavier than Cube B, as it causes a greater tilt when placed on the board."

                "answer": "A",
                "reasoning": "The task involves balancing the long board on the triangular prism and placing cubes to maintain balance. Observing the images, at step 000165, the green cube (Cube B) is placed on one side of the board, and the board remains balanced. At step 000203, the robot arm picks up the yellow cube (Cube A) and places it on the opposite side of the board. At step 000238, after placing Cube A, the board tilts downward on the side where Cube A is placed. This indicates that Cube A is heavier than Cube B, as its weight causes the board to tilt."

                "answer": "A",
                "reasoning": "In the provided observations, the robot arm is balancing the long board on the triangular prism and placing cubes to maintain balance. Cube A (yellow) is consistently placed closer to the edge of the board, while Cube B (green) is placed farther from the edge and closer to the center. This indicates that Cube A is heavier, as placing it closer to the edge compensates for its greater weight and helps maintain balance. If Cube B were heavier, it would need to be placed closer to the edge to counteract its weight. Thus, Cube A is the heavier cube."
