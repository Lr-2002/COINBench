                "answer": "B",
                "reasoning": "The images show the robot arm and a red cube near a cabinet. The question asks about the best approach to put the cube into the cabinet. Option A suggests moving an obstacle first, but there's no visible obstacle blocking the path to the cabinet in the images. Option B suggests navigating around the obstacle without moving it, which is more relevant since the robot arm might need to maneuver to pick up the cube and place it inside the cabinet. Therefore, navigating around any potential obstacles (like the cabinet itself) is the better approach."
