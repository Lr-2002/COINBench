                "reasoning": "The images show that the robot arm uses the pivot to push the cube. The cube is located far away from the robot arm, so the robot arm cannot directly grasp the cube. Therefore, the pivot is used to move the cube to the target position."

                "reasoning": "The robot uses the pivot to move the cube, which suggests that the cube might be too heavy for the robot to directly lift and move. Therefore, the pivot is used to provide leverage and make it easier to move the cube."

                "reasoning": "The robot arm is using the blue bar as a pivot to move the cube. From the images, it appears that the cube is too far away for the robot to directly grasp it. Therefore, the pivot is used to extend the robot's reach."

                "reasoning": "The cube is too far for the robot to directly grasp and move to the marker. The pivot allows the robot to indirectly manipulate the cube by pushing or moving the pivot, which then moves the cube closer to the marker."
