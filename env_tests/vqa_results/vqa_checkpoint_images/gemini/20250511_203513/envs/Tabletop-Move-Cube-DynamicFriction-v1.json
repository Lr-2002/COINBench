Lifting the cube and directly placing it to the target position is the most direct and efficient approach. Sliding the cube might be affected by unpredictable friction, and picking up the cube multiple times if it falls is inefficient."

This suggests that option B, sliding the cube while maintaining contact with the surface, is the approach being used. Option A, lifting the cube, is not observed in the images. Option C is not relevant to the task."
