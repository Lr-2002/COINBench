In the second image, cube B is on the ground and cube A is on the seesaw. In the third image, cube A is on the ground and cube B is on the seesaw.

By the last image, cube A is at the goal and cube B is still on the other side of the seesaw. This indicates that cube A is heavier, as it caused the seesaw to tilt and move it towards the goal."
