# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Balls-WithPivot-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick
Step 2: squeeze the ball into the dustban
Step 3: pick other balls
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the first ball and put it into the container (dustpan)
Step 2: pick up the second ball and put it into the container (dustpan)
Step 3: pick up the third ball and put it into the container (dustpan)
Step 4: pick up the fourth ball and put it into the container (dustpan)
Step 5: pick up the fifth ball and put it into the container (dustpan)
Step 6: pick up the sixth ball and put it into the container (dustpan)
Step 7: pick up the seventh ball and put it into the container (dustpan)
Step 8: pick up the eighth ball and put it into the container (dustpan)
Step 9: pick up the ninth ball and put it into the container (dustpan)
Step 10: pick up the tenth ball and put it into the container (dustpan)
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
**  
  While the model-generated plan describes its steps clearly and provides sequentially logical instructions for moving the balls, it disregards the critical action of picking the stick as specified in the ground-truth plan. This omission negatively impacts both completeness and correctness since the plan may fail under real conditions that require stick manipulation to handle the balls effectively. Without addressing this missing step, the plan cannot be considered adequate for the task

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness:** 50/100  
  The model-generated plan includes steps to move the balls into the container (dustpan). However, it completely misses the step to "pick the stick," which appears essential in the human-annotated ground-truth plan to manipulate the balls in this context. Without using the stick, the plan may not accomplish the task effectively.  

- **Correctness:** 30/100  
  The model-generated steps are logically sequential (picking and placing each ball one by one), but they disregard the required use of the stick to squeeze the balls into the container. Consequently, despite being logical within themselves, the steps deviate from the intended and necessary trajectory of the task as per ground truth. The error in methodology affects correctness significantly.  

- **Clarity:** 80/100  
  The model-generated plan is clear in its description of actions, using explicit low-level executor-friendly instructions such as "pick up the ball and put it into the container." Each step is detailed and understandable. However, it lacks instructions regarding essential tool use (e.g., picking the stick), which may cause ambiguity if the low-level executor depends on that precondition.  

- **Mean Score:** 53.33/100

This omission negatively impacts both completeness and correctness since the plan may fail under real conditions that require stick manipulation to handle the balls effectively.
