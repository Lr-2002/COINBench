# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Balls-WithPivot-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick
Step 2: squeeze the ball into the dustban
Step 3: pick other balls
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: put the ball into the container
Step 2: put the ball into the container
Step 3: put the ball into the container
Step 4: put the ball into the container
Step 5: put the ball into the container
Step 6: put the ball into the container
Step 7: put the ball into the container
Step 8: put the ball into the container
Step 9: put the ball into the container
Step 10: put the ball into the container
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 30/100
- Correctness: 20/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 37/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan is incomplete and logically incorrect for the given task goal, as it omits critical steps present in the human-annotated plan, such as picking the stick and considering other balls. Although the steps themselves are syntactically clear, their lack of coherence and relevance to the task reduces their practical usefulness. This causes the plan to score poorly overall

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 30/100  
The model-generated plan significantly deviates from the ground-truth plan. While it includes multiple repetitions of "put the ball into the container," it fails to incorporate essential steps, such as "pick the stick" (necessary for moving the balls with the pivot tool) and instructions related to managing multiple balls as seen in the ground-truth plan.  

- **Correctness**: 20/100  
The steps are logically flawed since they assume the balls are already in a manipulatable state and ignore the explicit task requirements, such as using a pivot to move balls. Additionally, the repetitive steps suggest no progression or proper sequence to complete the task logically.  

- **Clarity**: 60/100  
While the instructions themselves ("put the ball into the container") are clear and align with the task format required for the low-level executor, their repetitive nature lacks meaningful information about the overall goal. Thus, the plan is clear at the individual step level but fails to clarify the overarching structure or logic of the task.  

- **Mean Score**: 36.7/100  

- **Justification**:  
The model-generated plan is incomplete and logically incorrect for the given task goal, as it omits critical steps present in the human-annotated plan, such as picking the stick and considering other balls. Although the steps themselves are syntactically clear, their lack of coherence and relevance to the task reduces their practical usefulness. This causes the plan to score poorly overall.
