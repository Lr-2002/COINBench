# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Balls-WithPivot-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick
Step 2: squeeze the ball into the dustban
Step 3: pick other balls
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Identify the location of each ball on the tabletop.
Step 2: Pick up the first ball.
Step 3: Put the ball into the dustpan.
Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each remaining ball.
Step 5: Verify that all balls are in the dustpan.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 67/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan does not explicitly include the use of the pivoting stick (or "stick") to move the balls, which is crucial for the task goal in this specific benchmark ("Tabletop-Move-Balls-WithPivot-v1"). The ground-truth plan explicitly mentions using the stick to perform the task, whereas the model-generated plan assumes direct manual manipulation of the balls, which omits an essential step for this task.  
  - **Correctness**: The sequence in the model-generated plan assumes directly picking up each ball and putting it into the dustpan, which contradicts the logic of this task, as it requires the use of the pivot (stick). Additionally, focusing on picking balls step-by-step differs from the predefined sequence in the ground truth, which explicitly uses the stick to perform batch manipulations.  
  - **Clarity**: The model-generated plan provides clear instructions in simple, understandable language for a low-level executor. However, it deviates from the necessary "pivot interaction" and includes instructions (like verifying all balls in the dustpan) that are not constrained in the original ground-truth plan
