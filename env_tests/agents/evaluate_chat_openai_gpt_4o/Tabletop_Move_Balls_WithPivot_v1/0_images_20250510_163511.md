# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Balls-WithPivot-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick
Step 2: squeeze the ball into the dustban
Step 3: pick other balls
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: locate the balls in the environment
Step 2: locate the dustpan in the environment
Step 3: put the ball into the container (dustpan)
Step 4: repeat step 3 for all balls
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
**  
  **Completeness:** The model-generated plan includes instructions for finding the balls and dustpan but omits the use of the "stick" (pivot) to move the balls, which is critical to the task goal. Therefore, it lacks one essential step.

- **Justification:**  
  **Completeness:** The model-generated plan includes instructions for finding the balls and dustpan but omits the use of the "stick" (pivot) to move the balls, which is critical to the task goal. Therefore, it lacks one essential step.  

  **Correctness:** The sequence is partially logical but misleading; the task goal specifies that the robot should use the stick (pivot) to interact with the balls, which isn't reflected in the steps. The absence of "pick the stick" creates ambiguity and breaks the correct sequence necessary for achieving the task using the specified method.  

  **Clarity:** While the model-generated plan is clear and uses understandable low-level actions, it doesn't assign the correct tool or method ("pivot") for the task, which introduces clarity issues regarding the proper execution.
