# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Balls-WithPivot-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick
Step 2: squeeze the ball into the dustban
Step 3: pick other balls
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: put the ball into the container
Step 2: repeat the action for each ball until all balls are in the dustpan
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 40/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan does not include the step of "picking the stick," which is essential to perform the task. Moreover, it does not specify the explicit act of physically maneuvering the balls with the pivot, as implied in the task goal. Additionally, it skips mentioning "picking other balls" as explicitly as the ground-truth plan. It seems to generalize too much compared to the detailed ground-truth steps.  
  - **Correctness**: The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan is not logically correct, as it skips the necessary precursor action of initially picking up the stick. Moreover, “putting the ball into the container” is ambiguously aligned with the task goal of “squeezing the ball into the dustbin.” This leads to potential misunderstandings of the sequence.  
  - **Clarity**: Command formulations like "put the ball into the container" are unclear or too generalized compared to the task-level descriptions required for a low-level executor who needs explicit, <action> the <object> instructions such as "squeeze the ball into the dustbin." The generated plan also uses "repeat the action" for iterative steps, but it does not explicitly outline step-by-step instructions for each ball, potentially confusing a low-level executor
