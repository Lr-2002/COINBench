## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
**  
   - *Completeness*: The model-generated plan misses a core part of the ground-truth plan, namely placing the bowl on the plate and then the fork on the bowl. Instead, it focuses solely on actions involving the fork and performs no direct action on the bowl beyond an optional adjustment. Essential steps are omitted, leading to a significant deduction in score.  
   - *Correctness*: The order of actions is different from the ground-truth plan, which specifies placing the bowl first and the fork afterward. The model plan places the fork first, which deviates from the logical progression needed to meet the task goal as defined by the ground-truth plan.  
   - *Clarity*: The model-generated plan is generally understandable and uses clear language compatible with the low-level executor, such as "pick up the fork" and "put the fork on the plate." However, "adjust the bowl if necessary" introduces vagueness since it is conditional and less specific about what action is required. This vagueness impacts the clarity score slightly
