# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Clean-For-Dinner-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the bowl and put it on the plate
Step 2: pick the fork and put it on the bowl
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: search for the plate in the environment
Step 2: pick up the bowl and put it on the plate
Step 3: put the fork on the plate
Step 4: clean the tabletop area
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 75/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 62/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan deviates from the ground-truth plan both in step order (placing the fork on the plate instead of the bowl) and in clarity (suboptimal command phrasing for the low-level executor). The step to "search for the plate" is extraneous, and "clean the tabletop area" is too vague. Although it attempts to complete the task goal, it introduces errors and lacks precision in step clarity and order

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 75/100  
  The model-generated plan includes all the essential steps to organize the tabletop (bowl and fork placement) and goes one step further by cleaning the tabletop area, which adds an additional layer of tidiness. However, it fails to follow the correct sequence in placing the fork correctly as per the goal ("fork on the bowl" instead of "fork on the plate").  

- **Correctness**: 50/100  
  The order of steps in the generated plan is partly incorrect. The ground-truth specifies that the fork must be placed on the bowl after placing the bowl on the plate. However, the model-generated plan incorrectly instructs placing the fork on the plate. Additionally, "search for the plate in the environment" appears unnecessary given the task goal and does not match the low-level executor commands format. Thus, logical ordering and compliance are flawed.  

- **Clarity**: 60/100  
  The steps in the generated plan largely use high-level abstractions like "search for the plate" and "clean the tabletop area," which do not match the required format (<action> the <object>). This would make implementation challenging for the low-level executor. While specific object manipulations like "pick up the bowl and put it on the plate" are understandable, the overall clarity is subpar.  

- **Mean Score**: **61.67/100**
