# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Clean-For-Dinner-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the bowl and put it on the plate
Step 2: pick the fork and put it on the bowl
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: put the fork on the plate
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 20/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan fails to capture the full scope of actions needed for the task, resulting in a low completeness score. The included step is logically correct but out of order compared to the ground-truth plan, warranting a mediocre score for correctness. Clarity is high because the instruction matches the format required for the low-level executor

## Raw GPT Response
```
### Evaluation:

- **Completeness:** 20/100  
  The model-generated plan is missing an essential step from the ground-truth plan: picking up the bowl and placing it on the plate. It only includes an action involving the fork, which means it fails to complete the task as defined in the goal.

- **Correctness:** 50/100  
  The step included in the model-generated plan ("put the fork on the plate") is logically correct in isolation. However, it is not sequentially aligned with the ground-truth plan's order. According to the ground-truth plan, the bowl must first be placed on the plate before any action involving the fork.

- **Clarity:** 90/100  
  The step described in the model-generated plan ("put the fork on the plate") is clear, concise, and properly formatted for the low-level executor. However, clarity alone cannot compensate for the lack of essential steps.

- **Mean Score:** 53.3/100  

### Justification:  
The model-generated plan fails to capture the full scope of actions needed for the task, resulting in a low completeness score. The included step is logically correct but out of order compared to the ground-truth plan, warranting a mediocre score for correctness. Clarity is high because the instruction matches the format required for the low-level executor.
