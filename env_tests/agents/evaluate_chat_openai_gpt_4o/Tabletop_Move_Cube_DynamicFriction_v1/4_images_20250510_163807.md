# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-DynamicFriction-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: Step 1: pick the cube and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 3: move the cube to the marker
Step 4: place the cube on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 82/100

## Justification
**  
The generated plan is over-detailed compared to the ground truth, which reduces its completeness score. The sequence of actions is generally correct but introduces potentially extraneous steps that might not align with the simplest path to achieving the task. On the other hand, the clarity of instructions is excellent, as each step is clearly described and perfectly formatted for the low-level executor to understand and execute

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 70/100**  
The model-generated plan includes all the essential high-level actions needed to achieve the task goal (i.e., moving the cube to the marker). However, the intermediate steps (e.g., placing the cube in the holder and rotating it) introduce actions that are not explicitly necessary according to the ground-truth plan, making its completeness lower when measured against the reference.  

- **Correctness: 85/100**  
The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan is mostly logically correct and orderly. However, adding unnecessary actions like placing the cube in the holder and rotating it (if the blue face orientation is irrelevant to the task goal) slightly deviates from the ground truth. If the subtask of orientation or staging with the holder is critical to the current conditions, then the sequence is sound.  

- **Clarity: 90/100**  
The steps are clear, use actionable instructions, and are well-suited for a low-level executor. Each action is understandable and follows the given instruction format perfectly.  

- **Mean Score: 81.7/100**  

- **Justification:**  
The generated plan is over-detailed compared to the ground truth, which reduces its completeness score. The sequence of actions is generally correct but introduces potentially extraneous steps that might not align with the simplest path to achieving the task. On the other hand, the clarity of instructions is excellent, as each step is clearly described and perfectly formatted for the low-level executor to understand and execute.
