# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-DynamicFriction-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: Step 1: pick the cube and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube
Step 2: put the cube in the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 100/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 95/100

## Justification
**  
   - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan includes all essential steps needed to accomplish the task (i.e., picking up the cube and putting it on the marker). The two steps explicitly cover the one-step ground-truth operation.  
   - **Correctness:** While the steps are logically correct, there is a minor redundancy where the task could technically be achieved in a single step as in the ground-truth plan. However, the sequence itself is valid and achieves the same goal.  
   - **Clarity:** The steps are described in a clear and executable format that aligns with the low-level executor requirements. The only slight issue is inconsistency with the phrasing of "on the marker," which could have been directly inherited from the ground-truth plan as "put it on the marker" for better precision
