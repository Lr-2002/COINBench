# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-DynamicFriction-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: Step 1: pick the cube and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube
Step 2: put the cube in the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 100/100
- Correctness: 100/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 97/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan includes all essential steps outlined in the ground-truth plan, fulfilling the task goal completely (Completeness: 100). The steps are logically and sequentially correct, following the required order of first picking up the cube and then placing it on the marker (Correctness: 100). However, the clarity of the second step could be slightly improved by using the phrasing "put the cube on the marker" instead of "put the cube in the marker," which may cause minor interpretability issues for the low-level executor (Clarity: 90). Overall, the plan scores highly across all metrics
