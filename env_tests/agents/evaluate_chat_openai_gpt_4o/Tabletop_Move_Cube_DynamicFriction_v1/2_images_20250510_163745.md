# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-DynamicFriction-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: Step 1: pick the cube and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 4: place the cube on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 90/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan includes additional steps (e.g., using the holder and rotating the cube) that are unnecessary but still achieve the final goal. While the task is completed, these extraneous steps slightly diverge from the minimal required steps outlined in the ground-truth plan.  
  - **Correctness:** The steps in the model-generated plan are logically ordered and follow an appropriate sequence to achieve the goal, but introducing extra steps like placing the cube in the holder might cause inefficiencies or complications. Therefore, the logical flow is correct but suboptimal compared to the ground truth.  
  - **Clarity:** The individual steps are described in a clear and action-based format consistent with what a low-level executor can understand. This makes the plan comprehensible and executable
