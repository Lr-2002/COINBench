# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-DynamicFriction-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: Step 1: pick the cube and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 4: place the cube on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
**Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes extra steps (such as "rotate the holder till the hole upward" and "rotate the cube till the blue face upward") that aren't explicitly present in the ground-truth plan or necessary for completing the task as per the description. While it eventually achieves the goal, it introduces additional subtasks, reducing adherence to the ground-truth plan.

## Raw GPT Response

- **Justification**:  
  **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes extra steps (such as "rotate the holder till the hole upward" and "rotate the cube till the blue face upward") that aren't explicitly present in the ground-truth plan or necessary for completing the task as per the description. While it eventually achieves the goal, it introduces additional subtasks, reducing adherence to the ground-truth plan.  

  **Correctness**: The model's sequence is logically structured, and each step is valid in terms of robotic manipulation actions that could feasibly lead to the goal. However, it deviates from the ground-truth optimal sequence by adding unnecessary intermediate steps, which affects a perfect correctness score.  

  **Clarity**: The steps are described in a clear way for the low-level executor, using appropriate syntax and explicit actions. All actions are straightforward to understand, ensuring execution feasibility.
