## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 58/100

## Justification
**  
   - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan is incomplete as it skips essential steps such as "open the door" and "move the bowl" before executing "close the door." Without these steps, the task cannot be successfully achieved when obstacles are present.  
   - **Correctness:** While the single step provided ("close the door") is logically correct on its own, its execution is out of sequence and inappropriate given the presence of obstacles specified by the ground-truth plan.  
   - **Clarity:** The single action "close the door" is clear and understandable for a low-level executor. The action complies with the format accepted by the executor, leading to a high clarity score despite the plan truncation
