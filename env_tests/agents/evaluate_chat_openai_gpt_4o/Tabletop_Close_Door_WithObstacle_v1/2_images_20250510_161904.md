## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 54/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan skips essential steps from the ground-truth plan ("open the door" and "move the bowl") before closing the door. Only the closing step is present, so it is far from complete.
  - **Correctness**: The plan logically includes "close the door," which aligns with the task's goal, but the omitted preceding steps ("open the door" and "move the bowl") result in incorrect sequential logic. The task cannot be completed successfully without addressing these dependencies.
  - **Clarity**: The instruction "close the door" is clear and straightforward, adheres to the low-level executor's format, and is easy to interpret
