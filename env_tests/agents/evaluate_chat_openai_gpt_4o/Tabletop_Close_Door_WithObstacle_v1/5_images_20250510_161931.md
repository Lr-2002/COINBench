## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 75/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 72/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan is incomplete because it doesn't include handling the obstacle (moving the bowl), which is an essential step for achieving the task goal in scenarios with obstacles.  
  - **Correctness**: While the sequence of actions provided in the model-generated plan is logical and consistent for closing a door (grasping the handle, then pushing), it skips dealing with the obstacle, which leaves the execution prone to failure. Thus, it is partially correct but incomplete.  
  - **Clarity**: The model-generated plan uses concise and low-level instructions compatible with the low-level executor, making it very clear and understandable
