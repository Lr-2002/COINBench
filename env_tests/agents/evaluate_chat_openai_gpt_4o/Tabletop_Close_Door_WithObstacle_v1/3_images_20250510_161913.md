# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Close-Door-WithObstacle-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: move the bowl
Step 3: close the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: close the door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 20/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 44/100

## Justification
** The model-generated plan is **incomplete** as it ignores the critical step of moving the bowl out of the way before closing the door, which makes successful execution of the task impossible in a scenario with an obstacle. This omission drastically impacts the completeness score. The **correctness** of the plan also suffers since it suggests prematurely closing the door without addressing the obstacle, violating logical execution order. However, the single remaining step, "close the door," is clear and formulated in an executor-friendly way, resulting in a solid score for **clarity**
