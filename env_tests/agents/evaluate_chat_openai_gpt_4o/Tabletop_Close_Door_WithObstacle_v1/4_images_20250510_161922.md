## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 54/100

## Justification
**  
  - *Completeness:* The model-generated plan is incomplete since it completely skips essential steps such as opening the door and moving the bowl, which are necessary precursors to closing the door in this scenario (as inferred from the task goal "Tabletop-Close-Door-WithObstacle"). It only addresses the final step of closing the door, resulting in a low score.  
  - *Correctness:* The step included—"close the door"—is logically correct but is out of order in the context of the complete task. Without first performing the omitted steps (e.g., moving the bowl), this would not work in a real-world scenario. Some credit is given because the included step is part of the task goal.  
  - *Clarity:* The instruction "close the door" is clearly described using a low-level format understandable by the executor. Since the single action is clear and unambiguous, this criterion receives a high score
