# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoMicrowave-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the microwave
Step 2: pick the cube and put it into the microwave
Step 3: close the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube
Step 2: put the cube into the microwave
Step 3: close the microwave
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 80/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 78/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness**: The model-generated plan misses the critical first step: "open the microwave". Without this, the task cannot proceed as the microwave must be opened before placing the cube. While subsequent steps are included, this omission makes the plan incomplete.  
  - **Correctness**: The order of the provided steps is mostly logical once the microwave is presumed open. However, without explicitly including the "open the microwave" step, the logical sequence is disrupted because the cube cannot be put inside a closed microwave.   
  - **Clarity**: The steps are clear and follow the required format for low-level execution. The descriptions like "pick up the cube" and "put the cube into the microwave" are straightforward for a low-level executor. However, calling the step "close the microwave" instead of the more precise "close the door" slightly affects Clarity
