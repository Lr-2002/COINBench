# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoMicrowave-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the microwave
Step 2: pick the cube and put it into the microwave
Step 3: close the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: move the cube into the microwave
Step 2: release the cube inside the microwave
Step 3: close the microwave
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 40/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan lacks an explicit step to open the microwave door. Without this, the robot cannot access the microwave, making the process incomplete. While it includes placing the cube and closing the microwave, opening the microwave is essential for success.  
    - **Correctness**: The order and logic of the actions assume a precondition that the microwave is already open, violating sequential correctness. It skips a critical prerequisite action. Additionally, "move the cube into the microwave" and "release the cube inside the microwave" seem to over-complicate a simple task. Correctness is therefore poor relative to the ground-truth steps.  
    - **Clarity**: The use of vague phrasing like "move the cube into the microwave" and "release the cube inside the microwave" introduces ambiguity for a low-level executor. Instructions need to specify concrete actions like "pick up the cube, put it into the microwave," as shown in the ground-truth plan. This makes the model's plan harder to interpret
