# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoMicrowave-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the microwave
Step 2: pick the cube and put it into the microwave
Step 3: close the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 4: put the cube into the microwave
Step 5: close the microwave
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 75/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 73/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan has significant issues with omission ("open the microwave" is missing) and logical correctness (step order and unnecessary intermediate manipulations). Although each individual instruction is clear to the low-level executor, the added redundant steps reduce the effectiveness of the plan. The ground-truth plan aligns better with the minimal set of actions needed to complete the task efficiently and correctly

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness:** 75/100  
  The model-generated plan includes several extra actions that are unnecessary for completing the given task goal. While it does eventually achieve the goal of putting the cube into the microwave and closing the microwave, it omits the initial action to "open the microwave," which is essential for performing the task.  

- **Correctness:** 60/100  
  The sequence of steps contains logical and sequence errors with respect to the task goal. Specifically, the "open the microwave" action is missing entirely, while the action "put the cube into the microwave" is attempted without first ensuring the microwave is open. This breaks the logical order. There is also unnecessary manipulation of the cube that does not contribute to achieving the goal.  

- **Clarity:** 85/100  
  The steps themselves are described clearly and in a way understandable to the low-level executor (e.g., "rotate the holder till the hole upward" and "put the cube into the microwave"). However, there are redundant actions that dilute clarity by introducing unnecessary complexity.  

- **Mean Score:** 73.33/100
