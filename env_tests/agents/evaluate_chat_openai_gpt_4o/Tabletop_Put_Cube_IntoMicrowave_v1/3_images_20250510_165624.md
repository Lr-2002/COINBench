# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoMicrowave-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the microwave
Step 2: pick the cube and put it into the microwave
Step 3: close the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 4: put the cube into the microwave
Step 5: close the microwave
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 100/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 90/100

## Justification
**
  - The model-generated plan is complete and logically progresses toward the task goal, ensuring the cube ends up in the microwave and the door is closed. However, it includes extra intermediate steps that are unnecessary according to the ground truth, slightly reducing correctness and clarity. These additional steps could potentially complicate the execution without providing added benefit for this specific task

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 100/100**
  - The model-generated plan includes all essential steps to achieve the task goal. It ensures that the cube is placed into the microwave, and the microwave is closed at the end.

- **Correctness: 80/100**
  - While the steps are logically appropriate, some steps appear extraneous or unnecessary compared to the ground-truth plan. Specifically, the "rotate the holder till the hole upward" and "rotate the cube till the blue face upward" steps are not specified in the ground truth and do not seem functionally required for this task. The remaining steps follow a correct order.

- **Clarity: 90/100**
  - Most of the steps are described in a clear and understandable way for the low-level executor. However, the inclusion of additional intermediate steps ("rotate the holder till the hole upward" and "rotate the cube till the blue face upward") may introduce unnecessary complexity, slightly reducing clarity.

- **Mean Score: 90/100**

- **Justification:**
  - The model-generated plan is complete and logically progresses toward the task goal, ensuring the cube ends up in the microwave and the door is closed. However, it includes extra intermediate steps that are unnecessary according to the ground truth, slightly reducing correctness and clarity. These additional steps could potentially complicate the execution without providing added benefit for this specific task.
