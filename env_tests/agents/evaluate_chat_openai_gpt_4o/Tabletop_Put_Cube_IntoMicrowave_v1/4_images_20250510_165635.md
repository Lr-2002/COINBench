# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoMicrowave-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the microwave
Step 2: pick the cube and put it into the microwave
Step 3: close the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube
Step 2: put the cube into the microwave
Step 3: close the microwave
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 80/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 80/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan lacks an essential step to open the microwave before putting the cube inside, which is included in the ground-truth plan. This missing step reduces completeness since the task cannot be successfully completed as described.  
  - **Correctness:** While the steps included are in logical order (picking the cube, placing it into the microwave, then closing the microwave), the sequence fails because the microwave is not opened first, making the overall sequence logically incorrect.  
  - **Clarity:** The steps are described clearly in low-level instructions that the executor understands, such as "pick up the cube" and "put the cube into the microwave." However, "close the microwave" could be slightly imprecise, as the intended action is likely "close the microwave door." Despite that, clarity is mostly maintained
