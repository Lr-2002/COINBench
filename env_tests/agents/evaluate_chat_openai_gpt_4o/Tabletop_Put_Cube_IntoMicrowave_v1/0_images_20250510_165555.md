# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoMicrowave-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the microwave
Step 2: pick the cube and put it into the microwave
Step 3: close the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: locate the cube
Step 2: pick up the cube
Step 3: locate the microwave
Step 4: open the microwave
Step 5: put the cube into the microwave
Step 6: close the microwave
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 100/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 95/100

## Justification
**  
  **Completeness:** The model-generated plan includes all essential steps necessary to achieve the goal and even adds some extra steps that show thoroughness, such as "locate the cube" and "locate the microwave," which are implicitly assumed in the ground-truth plan.  
  **Correctness:** The step sequencing is mostly logical, but the task does not strictly require "locate the cube" and "locate the microwave" as separate steps, adding slight redundancy. While correct logically, it could be streamlined closer to the more efficient ground-truth order.  
  **Clarity:** The instructions are clear and well-suited for a low-level executor, conforming to the format and task descriptions provided ("pick up the cube," "put the cube into the microwave"). Minor verbosity slightly detracts from clarity but does not cause confusion
