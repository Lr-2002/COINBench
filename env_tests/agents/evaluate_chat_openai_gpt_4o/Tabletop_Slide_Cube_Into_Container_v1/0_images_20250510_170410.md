Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 4: put the ball into the container
Step 5: stack all the cube
Step 6: close the drawer
Step 7: open the drawer
Step 8: pick up the pen and put it to the marker
Step 9: pick up the bottle and put it on the marker
Step 10: find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 10/100
- Correctness: 5/100
- Clarity: 30/100
- Mean Score: 15/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan fails to address the task-specific steps, leading to extremely low scores for completeness and correctness. While the steps provided are syntactically clear and compatible with a low-level robot executor, the irrelevance to the task goal significantly reduces its overall effectiveness and applicability. As a result, the average score is poor

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness:** 10/100  
  The model-generated plan does not include the essential task-specific steps for completing the "Tabletop-Slide-Cube-Into-Container-v1" task. Specifically, it does not describe actions that match the ground-truth steps, such as moving the cube to the target location on the dustpan or pushing the cube down the slope. The steps provided are unrelated to the task goal.

- **Correctness:** 5/100  
  The task goal and required sequence of actions are entirely absent in the model-generated plan. While the individual steps are syntactically valid robotic instructions, they are irrelevant to the specific task. The sequence is also not logically or sequentially correct based on the task goal, although the steps themselves are in a reasonable order for unrelated actions.

- **Clarity:** 30/100  
  The individual steps are described in a clear format suitable for a low-level executor. However, since the steps do not correspond to the task goal, the clarity of the overall plan is significantly diminished. The lack of relevance and context detracts from its usefulness, even though the instructions themselves adhere to the required syntax.

- **Mean Score:** 15/100

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan fails to address the task-specific steps, leading to extremely low scores for completeness and correctness. While the steps provided are syntactically clear and compatible with a low-level robot executor, the irrelevance to the task goal significantly reduces its overall effectiveness and applicability.
