# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithStick-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and align it with the entry 
Step 2: push the cube with the stick to the T point
Step 3: pick up the stick and insert it to the space between the wall and the cube
Step 4: rotate the stick and push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: align the stick with the small cube
Step 2: push the small cube along the horizontal segment of the T-shaped path
Step 3: adjust the stick's position to align with the vertical segment of the path
Step 4: push the small cube along the vertical segment of the T-shaped path to the target position
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 85/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 78/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan covers the essential actions required to move the cube to the target position using the stick along the T-shaped path. However, it skips over explicitly describing picking up the stick and does not explicitly address inserting the stick into specific positions (e.g., the space between the wall and the cube). This omission reduces its completeness score somewhat compared to the ground-truth plan.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence logically follows the task's requirements but assumes implicit steps (like picking up and adjusting the stick without explicitly noting them). Furthermore, the subtle nuances of precisely rotating or inserting the stick in specific locations are missing, which slightly compromises the correctness.  
  - **Clarity:** While the steps include general guidance, the instructions lack the explicit action-object phrasing expected by the low-level executor (e.g., "pick the stick and align it with the entry"). Terms like "adjust the stick's position" and "align with the vertical segment" are ambiguous for a low-level executor and could be misinterpreted without clearer action descriptions
