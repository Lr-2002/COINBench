# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithStick-v1 (8 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and align it with the entry 
Step 2: push the cube with the stick to the T point
Step 3: pick up the stick and insert it to the space between the wall and the cube
Step 4: rotate the stick and push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Use the stick to push the cube along the horizontal segment of the T-shaped path.
Step 2: Rotate the stick to align with the vertical segment of the T-shaped path.
Step 3: Use the stick to push the cube along the vertical segment of the T-shaped path to the target position.
Step 4: Verify the cube is at the target position.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
**  
  While the model-generated plan aligns with the general intent and trajectory of the task, it lacks key preparatory steps, logical sequence, and task-specific clarity. The ground-truth plan is more explicit and adheres closely to the format needed for the low-level executor. The model-generated plan would likely not execute the task reliably without significant interpretive adjustments, especially at the executor's level

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 70/100**  
  The model-generated plan mostly covers the steps described in the ground-truth plan but omits essential intermediate steps, such as aligning the stick initially with the entry or picking and inserting the stick into the space between the wall and the cube. Additionally, the plan does not explicitly mention actions to orient or prepare the stick before beginning the interaction with the cube.

- **Correctness: 60/100**  
  The steps are logically plausible but not sequentially correct as per the ground-truth plan. For example, the model skips preparatory actions (e.g., “pick the stick” or “align it with the entry”) and jumps directly into using the stick to push the cube. Also, the movement to the T-point is inadequately described and lacks specificity, such as inserting the stick in certain physical configurations required for subsequent subtasks.

- **Clarity: 50/100**  
  The instructions are written in a higher-level, abstract language that may not be understandable for the low-level executor. Some steps are ambiguous and do not conform to the executor's expected format. For example, phrases like "Use the stick to push the cube" are not as explicit as "push the cube with the stick to the T point," and "Verify the cube is at the target position" is not an actionable step for the low-level executor.
