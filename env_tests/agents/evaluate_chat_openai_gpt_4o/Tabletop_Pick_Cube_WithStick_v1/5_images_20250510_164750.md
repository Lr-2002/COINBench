# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithStick-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and align it with the entry 
Step 2: push the cube with the stick to the T point
Step 3: pick up the stick and insert it to the space between the wall and the cube
Step 4: rotate the stick and push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Align the stick with the green cube.
Step 2: Push the green cube along the horizontal segment of the T-shaped path.
Step 3: Rotate the stick to align with the vertical segment of the T-shaped path.
Step 4: Push the green cube along the vertical segment of the T-shaped path towards the target position.
Step 5: Adjust the stick to ensure the green cube is precisely placed on the marker.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 75/100
- Mean Score: 83/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan covers the majority of the essential steps for the task (Completeness: 90). The sequence is generally correct, but the omission of insertion and the lack of clarity regarding adjustment steps detract slightly from correctness (Correctness: 85). Some steps (e.g., "adjust the stick," "align the stick") might be confusing or imprecise for a low-level executor, lowering clarity (Clarity: 75). Overall, the plan deviates in minor ways from the ground-truth but remains functional toward completing the task

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness:** 90/100  
The model-generated plan includes all essential steps to achieve the task goal. However, "pick the stick" and the explicit action of "insert it to the space between the wall and the cube" are missing from the model-generated plan, which might suggest assumptions about prior actions.

- **Correctness:** 85/100  
The sequence of steps in the model-generated plan logically progresses towards the goal, but deviates slightly from the ground-truth in terms of the stick's manipulation. For example, the insertion step is omitted, and the adjustment step (Step 5) could confuse execution unless clarity about its necessity post-placement is provided.  

- **Clarity:** 75/100  
While the model-generated plan describes steps clearly, some instructions (e.g., "adjust the stick" or "align the stick") are relatively abstract and may not provide precise low-level actions for the executor. The low-level robot may not understand "align" actions or "adjust" sufficiently without explicit instructions (e.g., "rotate the stick," "push the cube").
