# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithStick-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and align it with the entry 
Step 2: push the cube with the stick to the T point
Step 3: pick up the stick and insert it to the space between the wall and the cube
Step 4: rotate the stick and push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Position the stick behind the green cube.
Step 2: Push the green cube along the horizontal segment of the T-shaped path.
Step 3: Adjust the stick's position to align with the vertical segment of the path.
Step 4: Push the green cube along the vertical segment of the T-shaped path to the target position.
Step 5: Ensure the green cube is placed precisely at the target position marked by the red circle.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 85/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
**  
  The model plan is mostly aligned with the task goal but is incomplete due to the missing "insert the stick" step. The logical sequence is sound but deviates slightly from the detailed ground-truth plan. Clarity is the weakest area because the instructions are not sufficiently formatted as low-level actions explicitly executable by the robot's controller

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 85/100**  
  The model-generated plan broadly covers the objective of using a stick to maneuver the cube to the target position along the specified path. However, it misses a crucial step present in the ground-truth plan: "inserting the stick into the space between the wall and the cube." This step might be essential for properly adjusting the stick before pushing the cube to the marker.

- **Correctness: 90/100**  
  The steps of the model-generated plan follow a logical and sequential order, transitioning clearly from positioning to pushing and adjusting the stick for different path segments. However, the absence of a step equivalent to the ground-truth "insert stick" action means the logical continuity of achieving the task as per the exact goal may not be perfectly accurate.

- **Clarity: 70/100**  
  While the model-generated instructions are descriptive, they are not fully aligned with the syntax and style specified for the low-level executor. For example, phrases like "Position the stick behind the green cube" and "Ensure the green cube is placed precisely at the target position" are vague for a low-level executor. Breaking these into more specific, low-level executable actions would improve clarity.

- **Mean Score: 81.67/100**  

- **Justification:**  
  The model plan is mostly aligned with the task goal but is incomplete due to the missing "insert the stick" step. The logical sequence is sound but deviates slightly from the detailed ground-truth plan. Clarity is the weakest area because the instructions are not sufficiently formatted as low-level actions explicitly executable by the robot's controller.
