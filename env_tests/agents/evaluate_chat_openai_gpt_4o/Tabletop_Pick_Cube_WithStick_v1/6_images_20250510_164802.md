# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithStick-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and align it with the entry 
Step 2: push the cube with the stick to the T point
Step 3: pick up the stick and insert it to the space between the wall and the cube
Step 4: rotate the stick and push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Use the stick to push the small cube along the horizontal segment of the T-shaped path.
Step 2: Use the stick to push the small cube along the vertical segment of the T-shaped path toward the target position.
Step 3: Adjust the cube's position precisely onto the target marker using the stick.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan captures the general flow of the task but omits critical initialization actions and a specific mechanical interaction step outlined in the ground-truth plan. While logically plausible, essential details and sequential instructions for low-level execution are missing. Clarity also suffers due to vague phrasing, which is not directly translatable into low-level executor commands

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 70/100**  
  The model-generated plan misses the initial step of picking up the stick and aligning it with the entry point (which is essential for starting the task). It also omits the step of inserting the stick into the space between the wall and cube to ensure precise manipulation for the final positioning, which is listed in the ground-truth plan. While it captures the main high-level subtask of pushing the cube along the T path and toward the marker, it leaves out crucial details.

- **Correctness: 80/100**  
  The model-generated steps are logically sequential and plausible for moving the cube along the T path and toward the target marker. However, the absence of the step to insert the stick into the space between the wall and the cube could cause issues in terms of ensuring the cube is well-aligned for precise placement. Also, there’s ambiguity in interpreting whether the "adjust the cube's position" step sufficiently addresses the need for proper rotation discussed in the ground-truth plan's final step.

- **Clarity: 60/100**  
  The steps in the model-generated plan are described in general terms and are not fully aligned with the low-level executor’s instructions. For example, the provided instructions like "use the stick" and "adjust the cube's position" are vague for a low-level executor and do not explicitly frame the action-object relationship. Phrasing closer to the style of the permissible instructions (e.g., "push the cube with the stick to the T point") would have improved clarity.
