# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithStick-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and align it with the entry 
Step 2: push the cube with the stick to the T point
Step 3: pick up the stick and insert it to the space between the wall and the cube
Step 4: rotate the stick and push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the stick
Step 2: position the stick near the small cube
Step 3: push the small cube along the horizontal section of the T-shaped path
Step 4: adjust the stick to align the cube with the vertical section of the path
Step 5: push the small cube along the vertical section of the T-shaped path
Step 6: position the cube at the target position
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 85/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan performs well overall, capturing most of the essential steps (Completeness). It follows roughly logical sequencing (Correctness), although it slightly diverges from the ground-truth progression. However, its clarity lacks the precise and actionable phrasing required for a low-level executor (e.g., less reliance on descriptions and more on direct commands)

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 90/100  
The model-generated plan includes all essential steps to fulfill the task goal (Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithStick-v1). However, it lacks explicit mention of aligning the stick at certain crucial stages (e.g., the space between the wall and the cube as in the ground-truth plan).

- **Correctness**: 85/100  
The model-generated plan follows logical and sequential progression, but showing a slight deviation in describing the process near the end (e.g., "adjust the stick to align the cube with the vertical section of the path" deviates from rotating and inserting the stick into the space). Also, the ordering is not strictly aligned with the human-annotated ground-truth plan.

- **Clarity**: 80/100  
The instructions are sufficiently clear but could benefit from more precise and actionable phrasing for a low-level executor. For example, "adjust the stick to align the cube with the vertical section of the path" or "push the small cube along the horizontal section" are less specific and actionable compared to ground-truth instructions like "push the cube with the stick to the T point".

- **Mean Score**: 85/100  

- **Justification**:  
The model-generated plan performs well overall, capturing most of the essential steps (Completeness). It follows roughly logical sequencing (Correctness), although it slightly diverges from the ground-truth progression. However, its clarity lacks the precise and actionable phrasing required for a low-level executor (e.g., less reliance on descriptions and more on direct commands).
