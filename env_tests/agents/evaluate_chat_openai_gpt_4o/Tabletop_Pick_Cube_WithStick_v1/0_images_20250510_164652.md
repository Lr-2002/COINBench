# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithStick-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and align it with the entry 
Step 2: push the cube with the stick to the T point
Step 3: pick up the stick and insert it to the space between the wall and the cube
Step 4: rotate the stick and push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the stick
Step 2: use the stick to push the small cube along the T-shaped path
Step 3: position the small cube at the target position
Step 4: release the stick
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 75/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 68/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: While the model-generated plan includes some essential steps (e.g., picking up the stick, moving the cube), it skips critical manipulations from the ground-truth plan. Specifically, it lacks detailed steps such as aligning the stick with the entry, inserting the stick between the wall and cube, and rotating the stick before final positioning of the cube. This results in an incomplete sequence of actions.  
  - **Correctness**: The model-generated plan compromises logical sequencing in some key areas. For example, "using the stick to push the small cube" is too general, and the plan doesn't specify the necessary preparatory actions (like aligning the stick properly or using an appropriate angle). Further, "release the stick" at the end doesn't align with the ground truth process that concludes with a more nuanced final cube positioning.  
  - **Clarity**: The steps are described in a generally understandable manner but lack sufficient task-specific detail. Instructions like "use the stick to push the cube" and "position the small cube at the target position" are not low-level and precise enough for a robotic executor framework that operates on exact commands such as "push the cube to the marker" or "align the stick with the entry."
