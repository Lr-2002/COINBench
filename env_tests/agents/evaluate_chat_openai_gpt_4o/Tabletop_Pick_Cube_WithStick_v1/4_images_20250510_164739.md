# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithStick-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and align it with the entry 
Step 2: push the cube with the stick to the T point
Step 3: pick up the stick and insert it to the space between the wall and the cube
Step 4: rotate the stick and push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Use the stick to push the cube along the horizontal segment of the T-shaped path.
Step 2: Adjust the stick's position to align with the vertical segment of the path.
Step 3: Push the cube along the vertical segment of the T-shaped path toward the target position.
Step 4: Verify that the cube is correctly placed at the target position.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 80/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
1. **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes some essential steps to manipulate the cube using the stick, but misses critical actions seen in the ground-truth plan (e.g., "pick the stick" or "align it with the entry"). Additionally, the model plan skips the subtask about inserting the stick into the space and pushing the cube to the final marker, which means it doesn't completely cover all ground truth subtasks starting from the generated plan. Hence, the degree of inclusion is incomplete, hence scored 80.

- Justification:  

1. **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes some essential steps to manipulate the cube using the stick, but misses critical actions seen in the ground-truth plan (e.g., "pick the stick" or "align it with the entry"). Additionally, the model plan skips the subtask about inserting the stick into the space and pushing the cube to the final marker, which means it doesn't completely cover all ground truth subtasks starting from the generated plan. Hence, the degree of inclusion is incomplete, hence scored 80.  

2. **Correctness**: The sequence of steps in the model plan is fairly logical but oversimplified. It assumes a perfect alignment and doesn't involve precise sub-tasks like rotating the stick or inserting it between objects to achieve fine control, as seen in the ground-truth plan. These oversights introduce logical inaccuracies, and the order of execution also diverges from the intended ground-truth trajectory, scoring 70.

3. **Clarity**: The steps in the model plan lack clarity for a low-level executor. For example, "Use the stick to push the cube along the horizontal segment of the T-shaped path" and "Adjust the stick's position to align with the vertical segment of the path" involve high-level abstractions and fail to translate into concrete elemental instructions easily interpretable by low-level executors (e.g., specifying where to "push the cube" or "align the stick"). This results in unclear instructions, scoring 60.

The average score reflects that the model-generated plan is somewhat functional but significantly oversimplifies steps and lacks clarity, presenting challenges for low-level execution and precise goal completion.
