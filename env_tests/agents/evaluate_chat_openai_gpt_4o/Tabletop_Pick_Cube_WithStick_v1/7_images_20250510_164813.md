# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithStick-v1 (7 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and align it with the entry 
Step 2: push the cube with the stick to the T point
Step 3: pick up the stick and insert it to the space between the wall and the cube
Step 4: rotate the stick and push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Position the stick near the cube.
Step 2: Push the cube along the horizontal segment of the T-shaped path.
Step 3: Adjust the stick's position to align with the vertical segment of the path.
Step 4: Push the cube along the vertical segment of the T-shaped path to the target position.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan is functional but lacks the precision and step-by-step granularity seen in the ground-truth plan, which better adheres to the required low-level executor format. The omission of actions such as "picking up the stick" undermines its completeness and clarity. Although the sequence of steps is mostly correct, the vague descriptions limit its usability for execution

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 70/100**  
  The model-generated plan captures key steps for moving the cube along the T-shaped path but misses several essential details. For example, it does not explicitly mention aligning the stick with the entry, picking the stick, or inserting the stick into specific spaces, as described in the ground-truth plan. 

- **Correctness: 80/100**  
  The steps are mostly logically and sequentially correct; however, there is ambiguity in the model plan. For example, the description of "adjust the stick's position to align with the vertical segment" is vague about the action required (e.g., if it involves re-inserting or rotating the stick). The ground-truth plan provides more precise instructions. 

- **Clarity: 60/100**  
  While the steps in the model-generated plan are moderately understandable, they do not adhere well to the required low-level action-executor format (e.g., "Position the stick near the cube" is unclear compared to "pick the stick and align it with the entry"). The descriptions lack the granularity necessary for a low-level executor to carry out actions successfully.

- **Mean Score: 70/100**
