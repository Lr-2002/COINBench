# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 (8 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 2: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 3: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 4: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 5: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: stack all the cube
Step 3: adjust the cubes to maintain balance on the board
Step 4: put the ball into the container
Step 5: verify the balance of the board
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan diverges significantly from the ground-truth plan by introducing extraneous elements like cubes and containers instead of focusing solely on using balls to balance the pivot. While the instructions themselves are clear and sequentially logical, the lack of completeness and alignment with the task goal severely impacts its effectiveness overall

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 40/100**  
The model-generated plan lacks essential steps to meet the task goal of balancing the pivot using balls. Instead, it includes unrelated actions involving cubes, containers, and adjusting balance differently than required by the ground-truth task. There is no consistent progression of the task's objective using balls, which is critical for achieving balance.

- **Correctness: 50/100**  
Although sequential logic is evident (e.g., stack cubes first, adjust balance, and verify), the steps are partially misaligned with the specified goal (using balls for balancing, as per the ground-truth plan). This deviation introduces a flawed sequence in completing the task correctly.

- **Clarity: 70/100**  
The steps are written clearly and use understandable low-level instructions for the executor, consistent with the expected format. However, the inclusion of irrelevant actions (related to cubes and the container) diminishes clarity in relation to the actual goal of the task.

- **Mean Score: 53/100**

- **Justification:**  
The model-generated plan diverges significantly from the ground-truth plan by introducing extraneous elements like cubes and containers instead of focusing solely on using balls to balance the pivot. While the instructions themselves are clear and sequentially logical, the lack of completeness and alignment with the task goal severely impacts its effectiveness overall.
