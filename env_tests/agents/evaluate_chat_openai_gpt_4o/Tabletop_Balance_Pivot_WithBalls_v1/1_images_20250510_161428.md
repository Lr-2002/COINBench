# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 2: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 3: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 4: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 5: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: stack all the cube
Step 3: adjust the cubes to maintain balance on the board
Step 4: ensure the board remains balanced on the triangular prism
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 40/100

## Justification
- The model-generated plan fails to align with the core task of placing balls iteratively to achieve balance (resulting in poor Completeness and Correctness).  
  - Although some actions are clearly described in low-level terms, their irrelevance to the task lowers clarity as their intent is confusing for the executor

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 40/100  
The model-generated plan omits essential steps of placing balls into the holder, which are central to solving the task. Instead, it introduces steps like stacking and adjusting cubes, which are unrelated to the goal and do not satisfy the GT plan's logical sequence.

- **Correctness**: 30/100  
The model-generated plan does not follow the logical sequence of actions required for the given task. The GT plan explicitly focuses on iterative placement of balls to achieve balance, whereas the model's plan includes irrelevant actions like stacking cubes and adjusting them â€” actions that are neither necessary nor adequate for achieving the task goal. Additionally, the final steps in the model plan do not ensure logical progression toward balancing the tabletop.

- **Clarity**: 50/100  
The individual steps include clear phrasing compatible with a low-level executor (e.g., "pick up the cube, put it in the holder"). However, the described actions become ambiguous in purpose, particularly in steps like "adjust the cubes to maintain balance on the board" and "ensure the board remains balanced on the triangular prism," which are unclear for the robot executor without additional context or precision.

- **Mean Score**: 40/100  

- **Justification**:  
  - The model-generated plan fails to align with the core task of placing balls iteratively to achieve balance (resulting in poor Completeness and Correctness).  
  - Although some actions are clearly described in low-level terms, their irrelevance to the task lowers clarity as their intent is confusing for the executor.
