# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 2: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 3: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 4: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 5: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: stack all the cube
Step 2: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 3: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 4: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 5: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 47/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan does not align well with the ground-truth plan's emphasis on iteratively placing balls in the holder until achieving balance. It introduces irrelevant actions ("stack all the cube," "rotate the holder till the hole upward," "rotate the cube till the blue face upward") that are not part of the task goal, and it fails to handle the addition and balancing of balls altogether.  
  - **Correctness**: The steps are logically incorrect for this task. Actions such as stacking cubes and rotating the cube to achieve a specific orientation are unrelated and are misaligned with achieving the task's goal of balancing the tabletop pivot with balls. Furthermore, actions like "pick up the cube, put it in the holder" are repeated arbitrarily and don't follow the logical progression needed for balancing with balls.  
  - **Clarity**: The steps are written in a format that the low-level executor can understand, adhering to clear and low-level executable descriptions of actions. However, clarity alone is not sufficient when the steps themselves are irrelevant to or incorrect for the task
