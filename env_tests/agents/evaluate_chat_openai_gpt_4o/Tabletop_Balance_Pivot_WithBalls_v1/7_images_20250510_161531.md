# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 (7 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 2: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 3: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 4: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 5: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Stack all the cubes.
Step 2: Put the ball into the container.
Step 3: Adjust the placement of the cubes and balls to balance the board on the triangular prism.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 20/100
- Mean Score: 30/100

## Justification
1. **Completeness**: The model-generated plan is substantially incomplete compared to the ground-truth plan. The task focuses on handling balls within a holder to achieve balance, yet the generated plan includes unrelated actions (stacking cubes, putting balls into a container) and omits the iterative placement of balls into holders to assess balance.  
  2. **Correctness**: The sequence of steps is not coherent for achieving the goal described in the task. Steps related to adjusting objects for balance are vaguely described and skip critical iterative actions outlined in the ground-truth plan.  
  3. **Clarity**: The instructions are poorly aligned with what the low-level executor can interpret. Actions such as "Adjust the placement of the cubes and balls to balance the board" lack actionable specificity and cannot be executed by the robot as written
