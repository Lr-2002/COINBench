# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 (12 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 2: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 3: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 4: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 5: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: stack all the cube
Step 3: adjust the placement of cubes to balance the board
Step 4: verify the balance of the board
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 43/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan does not follow the essential steps outlined in the ground-truth plan. The task requires balls to be placed in the holder iteratively to check balance, but the model mentions working with cubes instead of balls. This suggests that key steps central to task completion are missing.  
    - **Correctness**: The sequence and logic of the model-generated plan are flawed relative to the task goal. It introduces incorrect actions ("pick up the cube," "stack all the cube") that do not align with the task requirements involving balls and balance, and adjusting cubes for board balance is not part of the task goal. The order is also inconsistent with the iterative balance check described in the ground-truth.  
    - **Clarity**: Although the model plan uses simple and clear low-level instructions, they are not task-specific ("adjust placement of cubes to balance the board" is vague and deviates from the original goal). The clarity is better than other aspects, but still lacks precision in describing the exact manipulations involving balls and verifying balance step-by-step
