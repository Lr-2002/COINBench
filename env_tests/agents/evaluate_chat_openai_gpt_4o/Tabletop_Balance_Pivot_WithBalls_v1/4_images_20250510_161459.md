# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 2: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 3: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 4: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 5: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Stack all the cubes on the board to maintain balance.
Step 2: Adjust the placement of the cubes to ensure the board is balanced.
Step 3: Verify the stability of the board and cubes.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 30/100
- Correctness: 20/100
- Clarity: 40/100
- Mean Score: 30/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan diverges significantly from the ground-truth plan and fails to account for essential task elements, such as interacting with the balls and holder. While the steps are somewhat understandable, they do not match the prescribed format for a low-level executor, and the logical sequence is incorrect and incomplete for the given task

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 30/100**
  The model-generated plan deviates significantly from the ground-truth steps. The task involves putting balls in the holder iteratively and checking for balance after each placement, but the model instead focuses on stacking cubes and adjusting their placement to balance the board. It misses the core requirement of interacting with the balls and the holder, which is essential for completing the task. No explicit mention of dealing with the "balls" or "holders" as described in the task goal.

- **Correctness: 20/100**
  The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan is logically incompatible with the ground-truth plan. While stacking and adjusting cubes could theoretically achieve balance, the plan does not align with the correct sequential actions for completing the task (putting balls into the holder iteratively). Furthermore, the order of steps like adjusting cube placement before verification is misaligned with the incremental nature of the ground-truth plan.

- **Clarity: 40/100**
  The model-generated steps are relatively clear in their phrasing but lack specificity and alignment with the task goal. It uses higher-level instructions ("adjust placement," "verify stability") that are likely difficult for a low-level executor to interpret and action correctly. The instructions are not aligned with the expected structure of "<action> the <object>" required for robotic manipulation tasks.

- **Mean Score: 30/100**
