# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 2: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 3: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 4: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 5: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: stack all the cube on the board
Step 2: adjust the position of the cube to maintain balance
Step 3: place additional objects (balls) if needed for balance
Step 4: verify the stability of the board
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan misses the core step described in the ground-truth, which involves placing individual balls sequentially in the holder and checking balance after each action. The plan only vaguely mentions placing "additional objects (balls)" without focusing on the iterative balance-checking process, which is the critical aspect of the task.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan is partially logical but diverges significantly from the ground-truth instructions required to achieve the task goal. There is no mention of the iterative nature of balancing, and it starts with actions involving "stacking cubes," which are irrelevant to the core task and lead to a misplaced order of operations.  
  - **Clarity:** The model-generated plan is more generic and less specific than the ground-truth plan. While steps are somewhat understandable and formatted reasonably for a low-level executor, terms like "adjust the position of the cube" and "verify the stability" are vague and do not directly instruct the robot with precise low-level actions like "put the ball in the holder."
