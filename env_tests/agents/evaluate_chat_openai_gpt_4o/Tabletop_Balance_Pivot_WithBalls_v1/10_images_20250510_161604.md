# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 (10 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 2: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 3: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 4: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 5: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Adjust the position of the long board to balance it on the triangular prism.
Step 2: Pick up the green cube and place it on the board to maintain balance.
Step 3: Pick up the purple cube and place it on the board to further stabilize the balance.
Step 4: Evaluate the balance of the board and adjust the cubes if necessary.

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 30/100
- Correctness: 20/100
- Clarity: 40/100
- Mean Score: 30/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits the specific sequence and actions of placing balls into the holder iteratively to test balance, which are key steps in the ground-truth plan. It introduces steps unrelated to the task goal, such as adjusting the position of a "long board" and using "cubes" instead of balls. Hence, the plan fails to include all essential steps.  
  - **Correctness**: The steps in the model-generated plan are logically inconsistent with the ground-truth task objective ("Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1"), which specifies using balls to test balance. The sequence doesn't make sense in this context (e.g., using "green cube" and "purple cube" instead of placing balls in the holder). The use of cubes and an unspecified balancing mechanism deviates significantly from the task and is incorrect.  
  - **Clarity**: While the model's plan uses clear and understandable language, it fails to follow the required low-level executor-compatible format (e.g., `<action> the <object>`). Steps like "Adjust the position of the long board to balance it" are not precise for a low-level executor and lack concrete instructions regarding objects from the environment. Moreover, the ambiguity in the steps ("adjust the cubes if necessary") reduces its clarity further
