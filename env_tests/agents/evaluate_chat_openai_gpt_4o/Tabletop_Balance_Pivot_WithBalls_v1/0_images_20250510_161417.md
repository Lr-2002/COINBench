# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 2: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 3: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 4: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 5: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Identify the long board and triangular prism in the environment.
Step 2: Pick up the long board and place it on the triangular prism to achieve initial balance.
Step 3: Locate the cubes in the environment.
Step 4: Stack all the cubes on the board to maintain balance.
Step 5: Adjust the placement of cubes as necessary to ensure the board remains balanced.

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan diverges from the ground-truth plan's object-specific actions and sequence, missing critical task requirements like balancing using balls. While clear instructions are provided, they are not adequately tailored for this environment or executor format, leading to deductions in completeness and correctness. The scores reflect the plan's partial alignment and clarity issues

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 50/100  
The model-generated plan does include steps for achieving balance and incorporates objects in the environment, but it deviates significantly from the ground-truth plan. The task goal requires the robot to specifically manipulate balls, placing them in the holder repeatedly for balance checks, which the model does not include. Model steps regarding cubes and boards only partially align with the goal.  

- **Correctness**: 40/100  
While the model plan has a logical flow and includes sequential adjustments for balance, it is not aligned with the exact logical steps from the ground-truth plan. The core subtask specified in the ground-truth plan ("put one ball in the holder and see whether balance") is absent. Instead, stacking cubes conflicts with the intended sequence and objects from the task goal.  

- **Clarity**: 70/100  
The model-generated plan is described in clear instructions, but the actions do not fully adhere to the low-level executor format requirements. Certain abstract descriptions like "identify" and "adjust placement of cubes" may be unclear for an executor that primarily works with specific object-action instructions, such as "pick up the ball and put it in the holder."  

- **Mean Score**: 53/100  

- **Justification**: The model-generated plan diverges from the ground-truth plan's object-specific actions and sequence, missing critical task requirements like balancing using balls. While clear instructions are provided, they are not adequately tailored for this environment or executor format, leading to deductions in completeness and correctness. The scores reflect the plan's partial alignment and clarity issues.
