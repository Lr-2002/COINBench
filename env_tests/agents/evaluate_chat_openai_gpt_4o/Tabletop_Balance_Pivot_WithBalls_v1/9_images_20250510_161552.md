# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 (9 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 2: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 3: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 4: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 5: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube and put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: stack all the cube
Step 4: adjust the placement of the cubes on the board to maintain balance
Step 5: put the ball into the container
Step 6: verify the balance of the board on the triangular prism
Step 7: make further adjustments if necessary
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 40/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan includes extraneous and irrelevant steps, omitting the critical iterative method required for balancing (Completeness: 40). The sequence deviates significantly from the logical order needed for the tabletop balance task (Correctness: 30). While the instructions are structured in an executor-friendly format, the lack of specificity undermines clarity (Clarity: 50). Overall, the plan demonstrates poor alignment with the task requirements and prioritization of essential steps

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 40/100  
The model-generated plan fails to account for the essential step of repeatedly testing balance after placing each ball in the holder. The ground-truth emphasizes verifying balance incrementally with each ball, which is crucial for achieving the task goal (Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1). Furthermore, several extraneous steps are introduced (e.g., "stack all the cube"), which are irrelevant to the task goal.

- **Correctness**: 30/100  
The sequence of steps is flawed and mismatched with the logic of the task. For instance, "pick up the cube and put it in the holder" and "stack all the cube" do not align with the goal, which is focused on placing balls—not cubes—into the holder incrementally and testing balance. Additionally, the flow from these unrelated steps to subsequent balance testing is inconsistent and illogical.

- **Clarity**: 50/100  
While the steps use simple language and are mostly actionable for a low-level executor, they lack specificity and relevance. Terms like "adjust the placement of the cubes" and "verify the balance of the board on the triangular prism" are ambiguous and not tailored to the core task. In comparison, the ground-truth plan uses a repetitive and straightforward structure explicitly focused on the essential actions for the task.

- **Mean Score**: 40/100  

- **Justification**:  
The model-generated plan includes extraneous and irrelevant steps, omitting the critical iterative method required for balancing (Completeness: 40). The sequence deviates significantly from the logical order needed for the tabletop balance task (Correctness: 30).
