# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 (11 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 2: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 3: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 4: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 5: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Stack all the cubes on the board to adjust balance.
Step 2: Put the ball into the container to ensure stability.
Step 3: Assess the balance of the board and make further adjustments if necessary.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 30/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 40/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan diverges significantly from the ground-truth plan needed to fulfill the task goal. It lacks essential iterative steps required for completing the balancing task (Completeness 30), presents logical inconsistencies in its sequence and method (Correctness 40), and lacks precise clarity regarding the task-specific procedure (Clarity 50)

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 30/100  
The model-generated plan misses key essential steps outlined in the ground-truth plan. The task goal specifies balancing using balls in the holder, yet the plan deviates from this by using cubes and containers, neglecting the necessary iterative balancing process with balls.  

- **Correctness**: 40/100  
The logic and sequence of actions in the model-generated plan are flawed compared to the ground-truth goal. While "stacking cubes" and "balance assessment" steps align with some aspects of balancing, they are not consistent with the ground-truth plan, which iteratively uses "put one ball in holder" actions.  

- **Clarity**: 50/100  
While the steps are described clearly enough for a low-level executor ("stack all the cubes," "put the ball into the container"), they fail to accurately describe actions specific to the task (e.g., balancing using balls and holders). Clarity is undermined by the misalignment with the task's conceptual requirements.  

- **Mean Score**: 40/100  

- **Justification**:  
The model-generated plan diverges significantly from the ground-truth plan needed to fulfill the task goal. It lacks essential iterative steps required for completing the balancing task (Completeness 30), presents logical inconsistencies in its sequence and method (Correctness 40), and lacks precise clarity regarding the task-specific procedure (Clarity 50).
