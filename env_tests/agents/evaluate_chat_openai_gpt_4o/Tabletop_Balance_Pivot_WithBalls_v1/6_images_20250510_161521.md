# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 2: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 3: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 4: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 5: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: stack all the cube
Step 3: adjust the position of the cubes on the board to maintain balance
Step 4: ensure the board remains balanced on the triangular prism
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 40/100

## Justification
Completeness: The model-generated plan omits essential steps explicitly described in the ground-truth plan, such as placing multiple balls sequentially in the holder and checking for balance. Instead, it introduces unrelated actions (like handling cubes) that are not relevant to the specified task goal.

- Justification:  
  Completeness: The model-generated plan omits essential steps explicitly described in the ground-truth plan, such as placing multiple balls sequentially in the holder and checking for balance. Instead, it introduces unrelated actions (like handling cubes) that are not relevant to the specified task goal.  

  Correctness: The task requires iterative actions involving placing balls in holders and verifying balance after each step, which is critical to the logic of the task. The sequence in the model-generated plan deviates significantly from this necessary procedural order, making the steps incorrect overall.  

  Clarity: While the model-generated steps are clearly written, they lack alignment with the low-level executor's required language (e.g., "adjust the position of cubes on the board to maintain balance" is high-level and vague). Additionally, the instruction set is partly disconnected from the intended task, reducing clarity for executors.  

Overall, the model-generated plan performs poorly in comparison to the human-annotated ground truth due to incomplete, incorrect, and somewhat unclear instructions.
