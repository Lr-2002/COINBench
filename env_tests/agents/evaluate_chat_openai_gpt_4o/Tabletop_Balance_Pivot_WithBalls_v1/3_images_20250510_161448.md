# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 2: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 3: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 4: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 5: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: stack all the cube
Step 3: adjust the position of the cubes on the board to balance it
Step 4: ensure the board remains balanced
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 30/100
- Correctness: 20/100
- Clarity: 40/100
- Mean Score: 30/100

## Justification
The **model-generated plan** lacks essential steps outlined in the **ground-truth plan**, which involves placing balls into the holder iteratively to achieve balance. Instead, the model introduces steps, like stacking cubes and adjusting their positions, that deviate from the task goal and fail to align with the expected process. Thus, it scores poorly on **Completeness (30/100)** and **Correctness (20/100)**: the proposed actions neither follow the correct sequence nor logically match the task requirements.

- **Completeness**: 30/100

- **Clarity**: 40/100  
- **Mean Score**: 30/100  
- **Justification**:   

The **model-generated plan** lacks essential steps outlined in the **ground-truth plan**, which involves placing balls into the holder iteratively to achieve balance. Instead, the model introduces steps, like stacking cubes and adjusting their positions, that deviate from the task goal and fail to align with the expected process. Thus, it scores poorly on **Completeness (30/100)** and **Correctness (20/100)**: the proposed actions neither follow the correct sequence nor logically match the task requirements.  

While some steps in the model-generated plan have reasonable clarity (e.g., "stack all the cube" and "pick up the cube, put it in the holder"), they introduce unclear actions and assumptions (e.g., "adjust the position of the cubes on the board to balance it") that make the low-level executor's implementation challenging. Therefore, **Clarity** is rated slightly higher at **40/100**.  

In summary, the plan does not effectively meet the task goal and shows significant divergence from the ground truth.
