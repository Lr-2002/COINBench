# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 (13 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 2: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 3: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 4: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
Step 5: put one ball in the holder and see whether balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Adjust the position of the green cube on the board to maintain balance.
Step 2: Pick up another cube and place it on the board to further stabilize it.
Step 3: Ensure the container with the ball remains stable on the board.
Step 4: Verify the balance of the board and make fine adjustments as needed.

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 25/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 40/100
- Mean Score: 32/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan misses the essential sequence of steps described in the ground-truth plan, which explicitly involves placing balls in the holder to test the balance. The model introduces unrelated steps (adjusting cubes, verifying the balance) that deviate from the task goal.  
   - **Correctness**: The steps in the model-generated plan do not follow the correct sequence required for the Tabletop-Balance-Pivot-WithBalls-v1 task. The logical progression of balancing using balls placed in the holder is absent. Instead, the model introduced unrelated steps involving cubes and containers, which are incorrect for this task goal.  
   - **Clarity**: While some steps in the model-generated plan are described in general terms, they are not clear or actionable for a low-level executor. Instructions like "Adjust the position of the green cube on the board to maintain balance" are ambiguous and do not conform to the <action> the <object> format. The ground-truth plan provides clearer, step-by-step instructions explicitly tied to the task requirements. The model's instructions are also inconsistent with the specified low-level action format
