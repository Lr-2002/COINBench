# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Lift-Book-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the book to the side of the book
Step 2: pick the book from the short side
Step 3: lift the book and put it on the high box
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: find and pick the book from the lower platform
Step 2: move the book to the higher platform
Step 3: place the book on the higher platform
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 80/100
- Correctness: 75/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 80/100

## Justification
**  
   - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan captures the essence of the task (finding, lifting, and placing the book on a higher platform). However, compared to the ground-truth plan, it omits some nuances, such as details about the orientation or specific side to engage with the book (e.g., "pick the book from the short side").  
   - **Correctness:** The model-generated plan has a logically coherent sequence of steps (find, pick, move, place). However, some subtleties related to the methodology described in the ground-truth (e.g., lifting and placing rather than "move") are missed. This can introduce inaccuracies in strict sequential correctness, especially if low-level controllers expect more precise instructions for lifting actions.  
   - **Clarity:** The model-provided instructions are relatively clear and consistent with low-level execution requirements. Actions such as "find and pick the book" and "move the book" are understandable, but "move the book" is slightly ambiguous compared to "lift the book and put it". The model's language could be more specific when translating movement
