# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Lift-Book-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the book to the side of the book
Step 2: pick the book from the short side
Step 3: lift the book and put it on the high box
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker
Step 2: move the book to the higher platform
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan does not include all essential steps from the ground-truth plan. Step 1 ("find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker") deviates significantly, focusing on a marker instead of the task-relevant "short side" or "high box." Additionally, the final "lift the book" step is not described explicitly, reducing completeness.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence in the model-generated plan does not logically fulfill the task's goal. While it identifies and picks the object (book) in Step 1, it moves the book to an ambiguous "higher platform" in Step 2 instead of a "high box." The plan therefore fails to follow essential ordering and logic from the ground truth.  
  - **Clarity:** While the individual steps are described in a generally clear manner for the low-level executor, the instruction in Step 2 ("move the book to the higher platform") is ambiguous because "higher platform" isn't well-defined and introduces room for interpretation
