# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Lift-Book-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the book to the side of the book
Step 2: pick the book from the short side
Step 3: lift the book and put it on the high box
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: find and pick the book from the lower platform
Step 2: put the book on the higher platform
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness (60):** The model-generated plan is missing details or intermediate steps provided in the ground-truth plan, such as moving the book to the side of the book and picking it specifically from the short side. These details could be crucial for ensuring accurate task execution, especially in cases where the book's position or orientation is important.  
  - **Correctness (70):** The sequence of steps in the model-generated plan is logically correct and aligns with the task goal, especially assuming the book is already accessible on a lower platform. However, it simplifies the task and skips potentially important instructions required for proper pickup or alignment (e.g., picking from the short side for secure lifting).  
  - **Clarity (80):** The model-generated plan uses clear, low-level instructions ("find and pick the book," "put the book"). However, it oversimplifies some details (e.g., specific descriptions like "short side" or "high box"). Despite this, the instructions are understandable by a low-level executor.

The model-generated plan performs decently but lacks fidelity to key intermediate steps and finer details outlined in the ground-truth plan. Simplifications in task representation impact the completeness and correctness of the plan relative to the benchmarked ground truth.
