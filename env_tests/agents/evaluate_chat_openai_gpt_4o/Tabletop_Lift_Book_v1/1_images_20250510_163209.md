# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Lift-Book-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the book to the side of the book
Step 2: pick the book from the short side
Step 3: lift the book and put it on the high box
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: find and pick the book from the lower platform
Step 2: put the book on the higher platform
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 80/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan omits an important step from the ground-truth plan, which is to "pick the book from the short side" (likely a crucial manipulation step for ensuring proper orientation and handling). Additionally, the "higher platform" destination is less specific compared to the ground-truth's "high box." While the plan partially addresses the task by specifying picking and placing actions, it lacks nuance from the ground-truth sequence.  
  - **Correctness:** The plan follows a logical and sequential order—finding the book, picking it up, then placing it on a higher platform. This sequence makes sense but is not fully aligned with the detailed steps in the ground-truth. For example, omitting specific instructions to lift and orient the book correctly may hinder successful execution.  
  - **Clarity:** The model-generated plan uses simple and clear language for the low-level executor, with concise instructions that align well with the preferred format (e.g., "find and pick the book," "put the book"). However, vague references to "lower platform" and "higher platform" reduce task precision slightly
