# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Lift-Book-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the book to the side of the book
Step 2: pick the book from the short side
Step 3: lift the book and put it on the high box
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: find and pick the book from the table
Step 2: move the book to the higher platform
Step 3: place the book on the higher platform
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan misses the essential intermediate step of picking the book specifically from the short side (required in manipulation tasks for stability). Additionally, it skips instructions about precisely lifting the book, which is crucial in grounding the motion trajectory. These omissions reduce this score.  
  - **Correctness**: While the model-generated steps appear sequentially correct, there is a logical gap in describing the specific action of lifting the book. Picking the book *properly* and moving it directly may result in less stable execution. Coordination with the "short side" detail from the ground truth plan is critical for accuracy.  
  - **Clarity**: The model-generated plan describes the task steps in a clear and understandable way for a low-level executor, using simple <action> the <object> instructions like "find and pick the book", "move the book", and "place the book". However, it doesn’t fully capture the nuances or handle precision (like picking from the short side)
