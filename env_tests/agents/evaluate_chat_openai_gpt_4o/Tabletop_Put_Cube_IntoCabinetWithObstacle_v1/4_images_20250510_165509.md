# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoCabinetWithObstacle-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pull/push the obstacle
Step 3: pick the cube and put it in the cabinet
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube
Step 2: put the cube into the cabinet
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
**  
- **Completeness:** While the model-generated plan includes the action of picking up the cube and placing it in the cabinet, it omits two essential steps: opening the cabinet door and dealing with the obstacle. Without these intermediate actions, the robot would be unable to execute the full task successfully.
  
- **Correctness:** The steps provided by the model are logically sequential, but the omission of essential steps compromises the overall correctness as the cube cannot be placed in the cabinet without first opening the door and removing the obstacle. Additionally, the model starts with picking up the cube instead of addressing the door and obstacle, which is contradictory to a logical workflow for the physical environment.

Additionally, the model starts with picking up the cube instead of addressing the door and obstacle, which is contradictory to a logical workflow for the physical environment.

- **Clarity:** The steps are described in clear, low-level executable language ("pick up the cube," "put the cube into the cabinet"), but because the plan omits critical interactions, the complete task goal wouldn't be understandable to a low-level executor when following only the provided instructions.
