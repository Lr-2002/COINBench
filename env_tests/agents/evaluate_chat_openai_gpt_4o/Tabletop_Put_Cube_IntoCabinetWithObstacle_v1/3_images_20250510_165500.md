# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoCabinetWithObstacle-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pull/push the obstacle
Step 3: pick the cube and put it in the cabinet
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 48/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan is missing essential steps. It does not include opening the cabinet door or addressing the obstacle, both crucial steps for achieving the task. While it does place the cube in the holder and attempts to close the cabinet door, these are incomplete and partially misaligned with the goal.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence of actions is partially incorrect. Closing the cabinet door is mentioned before the cube is actually placed inside the cabinet (and if the door is closed in Step 2, there is no step to open it to place the cube). Logically and sequentially, the plan fails to address critical dependencies like the obstacle handling.  
  - **Clarity:** The steps described ("pick up the cube, put it in the holder," "close the cabinet door") are clear and understandable for the low-level executor. However, the clarity does not compensate for the incompleteness and incorrect sequencing of the steps
