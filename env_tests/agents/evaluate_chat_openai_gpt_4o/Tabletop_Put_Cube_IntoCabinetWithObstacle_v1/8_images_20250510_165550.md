# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoCabinetWithObstacle-v1 (8 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pull/push the obstacle

```

Step 2: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 30/100
- Correctness: 20/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 33/100

## Justification
**Completeness:** The model-generated plan is missing essential steps. It skips "open the cabinet door" entirely, which is fundamental to achieving the task goal, as the cabinet must be accessible. The obstacle manipulation step is also omitted. It includes actions unrelated to the task goal ("put the cube in the holder" instead of the cabinet).  
  **Correctness:** The plan is not logically sequenced. For instance, "close the cabinet door" is mentioned without first opening it, and the action "put the cube in the holder" deviates from the goal of placing the cube into the cabinet. The conditions required for successful execution are not met.  
  **Clarity:** While the instructions are formatted in a way that aligns with the low-level executor requirements, the actions themselves contradict the task goal and create ambiguity in understanding the intended task
