# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoCabinetWithObstacle-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pull/push the obstacle
Step 3: pick the cube and put it in the cabinet
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube
Step 2: put the cube into the cabinet
Step 3: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan displays major issues with **Completeness** and **Correctness**. Skipping the step to handle the obstacle and omitting the initial requirement to open the cabinet door compromises the fulfillment of the task goal. While the actions themselves are well-articulated and would likely be understandable by a low-level executor, the overall sequence and lack of necessary steps make the plan logically inadequate for this task

### Evaluation of the Model-Generated Plan:

- **Completeness**: 50/100  
The model-generated plan misses an essential step explicitly mentioned in the ground-truth plan: removing the obstacle ("pull/push the obstacle"). Without this, placing the cube inside the cabinet cannot be achieved successfully if the obstacle obstructs the path.

- **Correctness**: 40/100  
The sequence of steps is not entirely logical given the task context. Attempting to "put the cube into the cabinet" in Step 2 assumes that the cabinet door has already been opened and that thereâ€™s no obstruction inside. However, the model skips these critical preconditions (opening the cabinet door and dealing with the obstacle). Additionally, "close the cabinet door" is incorrectly sequenced after "put the cube into the cabinet," as the step to open the door is omitted entirely.

- **Clarity**: 90/100  
The instructions themselves are clear and adhere to the low-level executor's required format (e.g., "pick up the cube," "put the cube into the cabinet"). However, the sequence and omitted steps reduce the practical clarity for execution.

- **Mean Score**: 60/100  

### Justification:
The model-generated plan displays major issues with **Completeness** and **Correctness**. Skipping the step to handle the obstacle and omitting the initial requirement to open the cabinet door compromises the fulfillment of the task goal. While the actions themselves are well-articulated and would likely be understandable by a low-level executor, the overall sequence and lack of necessary steps make the plan logically inadequate for this task.
