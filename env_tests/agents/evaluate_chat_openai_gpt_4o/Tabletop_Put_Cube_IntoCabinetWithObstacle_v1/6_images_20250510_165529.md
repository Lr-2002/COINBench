# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoCabinetWithObstacle-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pull/push the obstacle
Step 3: pick the cube and put it in the cabinet
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: put the cube in the cabinet
Step 2: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan is incomplete because it omits essential steps, particularly opening the cabinet door and addressing the obstacle. These steps are critical for completing the task. While the plan does include actions that belong to the task (e.g., putting the cube in the cabinet and closing the door), the sequence is logically flawed as the cabinet door must be opened before placing the cube inside. In terms of clarity, the instructions for the low-level executor are clear for the steps included, but the task's execution cannot proceed due to missing steps. Therefore, the limited clarity does not offset deficiencies in other criteria
