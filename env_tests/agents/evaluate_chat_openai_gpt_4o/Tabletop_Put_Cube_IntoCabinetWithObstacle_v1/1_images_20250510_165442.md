# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoCabinetWithObstacle-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pull/push the obstacle
Step 3: pick the cube and put it in the cabinet
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan is missing several essential steps from the ground-truth plan, such as opening the cabinet door and removing/pushing the obstacle. Thus, the robot cannot accomplish the task goal fully.  
  - **Correctness**: The sequence of steps in the model-generated plan is logically flawed. Closing the cabinet door is listed after step 1, but the cube would never be placed inside the cabinet because the door was never opened, nor was the obstacle addressed. Misalignment with the goal reduces the score significantly.  
  - **Clarity**: The steps in the model-generated plan are written in a format understandable by the low-level executor, but step 1 ("pick up the cube, put it in the holder") is extraneous and unclear in relation to the task goal. This reduces clarity but does not render the plan incomprehensible
