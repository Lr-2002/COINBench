# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoCabinetWithObstacle-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pull/push the obstacle
Step 3: pick the cube and put it in the cabinet
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 47/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan fails to include essential steps outlined in the ground-truth plan, such as "open the cabinet door" and "pull/push the obstacle." These steps are critical for completing the task due to the presence of an obstacle and the initial closed cabinet door. This reduces the **completeness** score significantly, as the plan is missing two necessary actions.  
The **correctness** is poor due to logical inconsistencies. For example, the model specifies "close the cabinet door" before the cube is inserted into the cabinet. Additionally, the act of "pick up the cube, put it in the holder" does not directly help achieve the task goal. The sequence lacks coherence relative to the actual goal.  
Regarding **clarity**, while the steps are clearly described in a format suitable for the low-level executor ("<action> the <object>"), they fail to align with the overarching task goal. For example, "put it in the holder" is clear in intent but misaligned with the goal. This results in a middling clarity score
