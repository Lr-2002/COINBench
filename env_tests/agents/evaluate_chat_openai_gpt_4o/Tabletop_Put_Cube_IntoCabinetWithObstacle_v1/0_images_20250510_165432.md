# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoCabinetWithObstacle-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pull/push the obstacle
Step 3: pick the cube and put it in the cabinet
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: identify the object to be placed into the cabinet
Step 3: pick up the object
Step 4: put the object into the cabinet
Step 5: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 72/100

## Justification
**  
  While the model-generated plan is clear for the executor and mostly logical in sequence, it lacks the critical step of addressing the obstacle, which makes it incomplete for fulfilling the task goal. The omission impacts both completeness and correctness. It remains clear overall but includes a redundant identification step that detracts from efficiency

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 60/100**  
  The model-generated plan includes steps for opening the cabinet door, identifying the object, picking it up, placing it in the cabinet, and closing the cabinet door. However, it omits the critical step of handling the obstacle (pulling/pushing it) to ensure the cube can be placed in the cabinet without interference.

- **Correctness: 70/100**  
  The steps logically follow a sequential order, but the absence of obstacle handling creates a contradiction in the original problem's task constraints, as the cube can't be correctly placed in the cabinet without first addressing the obstacle.

- **Clarity: 85/100**  
  The model-generated plan is described in a clear and understandable way, with instructions suitable for the low-level executor. Each action is specific and actionable. However, the unnecessary inclusion of "identify the object to be placed into the cabinet," which is redundant and implicit in the picking action, reduces conciseness slightly.

- **Mean Score: 72/100**

- **Justification:**  
  While the model-generated plan is clear for the executor and mostly logical in sequence, it lacks the critical step of addressing the obstacle, which makes it incomplete for fulfilling the task goal. The omission impacts both completeness and correctness. It remains clear overall but includes a redundant identification step that detracts from efficiency.
