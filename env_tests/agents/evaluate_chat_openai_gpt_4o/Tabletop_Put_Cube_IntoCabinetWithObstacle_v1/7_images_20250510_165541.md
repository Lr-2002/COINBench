# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Cube-IntoCabinetWithObstacle-v1 (7 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pull/push the obstacle
Step 3: pick the cube and put it in the cabinet
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: put the object into the cabinet
Step 2: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 48/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan is overly brief and skips crucial steps required for successful task completion, making it incomplete. The lack of consideration for prerequisites (the open cabinet door and obstacle removal) results in logical inaccuracies. While individual steps are somewhat clear, the overall plan is overly generic and ambiguous when compared to the ground-truth plan, which meticulously accounts for all necessary actions and ensures clarity of execution

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 33/100**  
The model-generated plan fails to include the required steps to open the cabinet door and address the obstacle. These are critical steps outlined in the ground-truth plan before placing the object (cube) into the cabinet, making the plan largely incomplete.

- **Correctness: 50/100**  
The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan is logically flawed, as it does not consider the obstacle or the state of the cabinet door (whether it is open or closed). The step "put the object into the cabinet" implies that these preceding conditions are already met, which is incorrect given the task context.

- **Clarity: 60/100**  
While the steps are written in an actionable format for a low-level executor, the model-generated plan lacks detail. The term "put the object" is generic and could confuse the executor, who expects specific instructions like "pick the cube and put it in the cabinet." Additionally, there is no mention of managing the obstacle or opening the cabinet door.

- **Mean Score: 48/100**  

- **Justification:**  
The model-generated plan is overly brief and skips crucial steps required for successful task completion, making it incomplete. The lack of consideration for prerequisites (the open cabinet door and obstacle removal) results in logical inaccuracies. While individual steps are somewhat clear, the overall plan is overly generic and ambiguous when compared to the ground-truth plan, which meticulously accounts for all necessary actions and ensures clarity of execution.
