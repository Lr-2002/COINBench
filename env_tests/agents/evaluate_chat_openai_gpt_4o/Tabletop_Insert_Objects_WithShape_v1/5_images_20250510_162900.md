# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-Objects-WithShape-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the triangle and put it on the left hole
Step 2: pick the round one and put it to the round hole
Step 3: pick the square one and put it to the central hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: pick up the triangular stick and insert it into the triangular hole
Step 4: pick up the circular stick and insert it into the circular hole
Step 5: verify all sticks are inserted correctly into their respective holes
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan includes key steps for inserting the triangular and circular objects but lacks completeness due to omitting the square object entirely. The sequence of actions deviates from the ground-truth logic, and an unnecessary rotation step complicates the process. However, the instructions are clear for low-level execution except for minor ambiguities. To improve, the plan needs to focus directly on placing all three objects into their respective holes in the right sequence

- Completeness: 70/100  
The model-generated plan partially completes the task but omits specific mention of the square object (cube) being placed into the central hole. Although Step 1 mentions a cube being placed in a holder, it doesn't align logically with the expected task. Verification of the inserted sticks (Step 5) is an additional step that wasn't explicitly required but may be extraneous.  

- Correctness: 60/100  
The steps are out of sequence compared to the ground-truth plan. For instance, placing the cube in the holder (Step 1) and rotating it (Step 2) don’t seem relevant to the task goal. Additionally, the sequence diverges in terms of logical progression and fails to address the central hole clearly. Steps 3 and 4 are logically sound for inserting the triangular and circular sticks, but they skip the square one.  

- Clarity: 80/100  
The steps are mostly described in a low-level manner that a robotic executor can follow, e.g., “pick up the triangular stick and insert it into the triangular hole.” However, terminology like "cube in the holder" for the central square object and the holder rotation step may confuse the executor regarding the actual task goal.
