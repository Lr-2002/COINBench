# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-Objects-WithShape-v1 (7 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the triangle and put it on the left hole
Step 2: pick the round one and put it to the round hole
Step 3: pick the square one and put it to the central hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the first stick from the table
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: put the stick into the corresponding hole
Step 4: pick up the second stick from the table
Step 5: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 6: put the stick into the corresponding hole
Step 7: pick up the third stick from the table
Step 8: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 9: put the stick into the corresponding hole
Step 10: repeat the process for any remaining sticks
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes steps that appear to address inserting objects (referred to as "sticks") into holes, which is relevant to the task goal. However, there is some ambiguity about whether the described process explicitly comprehends distinctions between shapes like triangle, round, or square, as outlined in the ground-truth plan. This omission results in partial coverage of the task requirements.

This omission results in partial coverage of the task requirements.  

  - **Correctness**: The model-generated plan introduces unnecessary steps, such as repeatedly rotating the holder and vaguely instructing to "repeat the process for any remaining sticks." This procedural deviation from the ground-truth plan creates logical redundancy and inefficiency. It also fails to follow the correct sequence implied in the specific task (e.g., addressing shaped objects explicitly in order).  

  - **Clarity**: While written clearly, the steps in the model-generated plan deviate from the low-level executor's expected instruction syntax. For instance, actions like "pick up the first stick from the table" or "repeat the process" are overly abstract and not tailored for clear execution. The lack of precise language (e.g., naming shapes or holes explicitly) reduces its usability for a low-level executor.
