# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-Objects-WithShape-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the triangle and put it on the left hole
Step 2: pick the round one and put it to the round hole
Step 3: pick the square one and put it to the central hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cylindrical stick
Step 2: put the cylindrical stick into the cylindrical hole
Step 3: pick up the triangular stick
Step 4: put the triangular stick into the triangular hole
Step 5: pick up the square stick
Step 6: put the square stick into the square hole
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 95/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 92/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan includes all the required manipulations corresponding to the task goal, with each shape (triangular, round/cylindrical, and square) being placed in its appropriate hole. However, the mention of "cylindrical stick" instead of a "round one" indicates a possible misalignment in the terminology between plans, which slightly affects completeness.  
  - **Correctness:** The steps are correctly sequenced, and each manipulation aligns logically with the task. However, the sequence and naming of the round object as "cylindrical" conflicts with the ground-truth, potentially leading to confusion.  
  - **Clarity:** While the instructions are generally clear and follow the required "<action> the <object>" structure, the inconsistent naming (e.g., "cylindrical stick" instead of "round one") reduces clarity and could complicate understanding for low-level executors who rely on precise conventions. Adjusting the object naming for consistency with the ground-truth would remedy this issue
