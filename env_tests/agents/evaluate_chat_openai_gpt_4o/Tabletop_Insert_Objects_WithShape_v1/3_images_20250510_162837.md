# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-Objects-WithShape-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the triangle and put it on the left hole
Step 2: pick the round one and put it to the round hole
Step 3: pick the square one and put it to the central hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: pick up the cylindrical stick, put it in the holder
Step 4: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 5: pick up the triangular stick, put it in the holder
Step 6: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 7: pick up the rectangular stick, put it in the holder
Step 8: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 9: verify all sticks are properly inserted into their corresponding holes
Step 10: adjust any misplaced sticks if necessary
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 45/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 58/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan deviates significantly from the ground-truth plan, adding unnecessary steps, redundancies (e.g., holder rotations), and post-task verification that are not strictly necessary for achieving the goal. While the steps are well-defined for a low-level executor, the logical order and efficiency of the plan are compromised. Strategic alignment with the task goal, as shown in the ground-truth plan, would improve its completeness and correctness

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 60/100**  
The model-generated plan includes steps for inserting objects into the holder and orienting them properly, but its approach diverges significantly from the ground-truth plan. While it does account for placing objects in holes, certain unnecessary steps (e.g., inserting all objects into a holder first and rotating the holder multiple times) complicate task execution and lead to inefficiencies. Simple placement into the respective holes as per the ground-truth plan would suffice.

- **Correctness: 45/100**  
The model-generated plan contains logical inconsistencies and does not follow a sequential arrangement that matches the task's requirements. The insertion into the holder and subsequent rotations are redundant, and the verification/adjustment steps occur after all objects are placed, which doesn't align well with the original sequence provided in the ground-truth plan.

- **Clarity: 70/100**  
The steps described in the model-generated plan are clear for a low-level executor, as it uses measurable, recognizable actions like "rotate the holder," "pick up the triangular stick," and "verify all sticks." However, the unnecessary complexity and additional steps make the overall description less aligned to the simple task goal. The low-level executor may also find verifying and adjusting sticks ambiguous if exact instructions are not pre-defined.

- **Mean Score: 58.33/100**
