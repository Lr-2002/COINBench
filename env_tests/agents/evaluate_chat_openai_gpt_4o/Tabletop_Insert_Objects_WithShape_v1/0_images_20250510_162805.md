# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-Objects-WithShape-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the triangle and put it on the left hole
Step 2: pick the round one and put it to the round hole
Step 3: pick the square one and put it to the central hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Identify the sticks on the table.
Step 2: Identify the corresponding holes for each stick.
Step 3: Pick up the first stick.
Step 4: Insert the first stick into its corresponding hole.
Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all remaining sticks.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** While the model-generated plan addresses the general task (i.e., inserting objects into corresponding holes), it fails to specify critical details such as the shape of each object (triangle, round, square) and their specific placement order, which are present in the ground-truth plan. This lack of detail makes it incomplete relative to the specificity required by the ground-truth plan.  
  - **Correctness:** The general workflow of identifying objects, matching them with corresponding holes, and inserting them is logical. However, the steps are ambiguous, and the sequential emphasis on specific shapes and corresponding placement order (as defined in the ground truth) is entirely absent. This undermines the logical and sequential correctness of the plan.  
  - **Clarity:** The instructions are written at a higher level of abstraction ("Identify sticks," "Insert first stick," etc.) rather than breaking them down into actionable steps compatible with the low-level executor's capabilities (e.g., "pick the triangle and put it on the left hole"). The reliance on generic phrasing ("Repeat steps 3 and 4") further reduces clarity and makes the plan infeasible for the executor as described
