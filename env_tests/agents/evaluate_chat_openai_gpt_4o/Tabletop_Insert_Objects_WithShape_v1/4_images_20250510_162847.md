# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-Objects-WithShape-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the triangle and put it on the left hole
Step 2: pick the round one and put it to the round hole
Step 3: pick the square one and put it to the central hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the first stick from the table
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: put the stick into the corresponding hole
Step 4: pick up the second stick from the table
Step 5: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 6: put the stick into the corresponding hole
Step 7: pick up the third stick from the table
Step 8: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 9: put the stick into the corresponding hole
Step 10: repeat the process for any remaining sticks
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 30/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 40/100
- Mean Score: 40/100

## Justification
**Completeness**: The model-generated plan significantly diverges from the human-annotated ground truth in its descriptions, as it refers to "sticks" instead of the triangle, round, and square objects specified. Furthermore, the specific goal of placing each shape in its corresponding hole is either unclear or absent. While some general structure is present (picking up objects and inserting them into holes), it does not faithfully cover all essential steps or their specific requirements.  
  **Correctness**: The logic within the model-generated plan is sequentially consistent (pick, rotate holder, insert), but it does not correctly align with the ground truth goal of identifying and matching shapes to precise corresponding holes. The order and specificity of matching the objects with their designated holes are critical and are either missing or ambiguous.  
  **Clarity**: The model uses relatively vague instructions ("pick up the first stick," "corresponding hole") and does not explicitly align with the task's requirements or clearly describe the unique characteristics of each object. Additionally, "repeat the process for any remaining sticks" lacks clarity for an executor
