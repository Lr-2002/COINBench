# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-Objects-WithShape-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the triangle and put it on the left hole
Step 2: pick the round one and put it to the round hole
Step 3: pick the square one and put it to the central hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: pick up the cylindrical stick, put it in the holder
Step 4: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 5: pick up the triangular stick, put it in the holder
Step 6: rotate the holder till the hole upward
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 72/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan deviates from the ground-truth plan in terms of approach, introducing a "holder" mechanism and repetitive rotation steps. While it appears systematic, it misses the task's specific requirements for placing the objects into designated holes (e.g., left hole, round hole, central hole). The steps themselves are clearly articulated and follow a logical sequence, but the approach is unnecessarily convoluted and incomplete compared to the ground-truth plan. This limits its effectiveness in achieving the task goal

## Raw GPT Response

- **Completeness**: 70/100  
  The model-generated plan covers all the required objects for insertion but deviates significantly in its approach compared to the ground-truth plan. While all objects (triangle, round/cylindrical, and square) seem to be addressed implicitly, essential details about their specific placements (e.g., left hole, round hole, central hole) are missing. The plan doesn't explicitly accomplish the defined goal since it doesn't specify hole positions or object-to-hole mappings.

- **Correctness**: 60/100  
  The sequence of instructions is logically coherent and follows a consistent pattern (pick up, then rotate the holder), but it does not align with the task goal. The actions seem to assume the use of a "holder" mechanism, which is not indicated in the ground-truth plan. The order of placement and rotation steps is methodical but lacks correspondence to the actual goal of mapping shapes to specific holes. Therefore, the task execution would likely fail to achieve the intended goal.

- **Clarity**: 85/100  
  The model-generated steps are clearly described and understandable for a low-level executor. However, the instructions introduce unnecessary complexity (e.g., use of a holder, repeated rotations) that might confuse someone interpreting the task, especially when this mechanism is not referenced in the ground-truth plan. The low-level actions themselves are clear, but the overarching instruction to match shapes to holes is obfuscated.

- **Mean Score**: 71.67/100
