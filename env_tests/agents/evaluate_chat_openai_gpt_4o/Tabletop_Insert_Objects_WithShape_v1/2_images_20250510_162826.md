# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-Objects-WithShape-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the triangle and put it on the left hole
Step 2: pick the round one and put it to the round hole
Step 3: pick the square one and put it to the central hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the first stick
Step 2: insert the first stick into the corresponding hole
Step 3: pick up the second stick
Step 4: insert the second stick into the corresponding hole
Step 5: pick up the third stick
Step 6: insert the third stick into the corresponding hole
Step 7: pick up the fourth stick
Step 8: insert the fourth stick into the corresponding hole
Step 9: pick up the fifth stick
Step 10: insert the fifth stick into the corresponding hole
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 20/100
- Mean Score: 30/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan fails to align with the task goal. It introduces extraneous steps (handling five sticks) that aren’t relevant to the stated goal of placing three object shapes (triangle, round, square) into specific holes. Additionally, it misses specific references to the shapes outlined in the ground-truth plan. As a result, only a small part of the content aligns with the goal.  
- **Correctness**: The sequence of picking and inserting objects is logical, but the plan strays too far from the task goal. The instructions reference "sticks" instead of shapes, and the transition between the steps (e.g., "insert into the corresponding hole") is ambiguous since it lacks correspondence with the ground-truth objects (triangle, round, square).  
- **Clarity**: The plan's terminology is vague and inconsistent with the low-level executor's expected language. Terms like "stick" and "corresponding hole" are unclear and not tied to specific objects or actions, making it hard for the executor to follow. Furthermore, the reference to five distinct sticks adds confusion when only three objects are outlined in the task goal
