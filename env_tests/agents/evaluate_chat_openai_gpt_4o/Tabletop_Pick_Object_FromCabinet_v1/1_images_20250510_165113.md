# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Object-FromCabinet-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door 
Step 2: pick the object in the cabinet 
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pick up the object from the cabinet
Step 3: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 80/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 87/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan includes all essential steps for interacting with the cabinet and manipulating the object, but it introduces a step ("close the cabinet door") not described in the ground-truth plan. While closing the cabinet might logically follow opening it, the ground-truth plan prioritizes placing the object on the marker, which is a key part of the task. This omission affects **completeness** as the plan doesn't explicitly include the prescribed "put it on the marker" step.

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 80/100  
- **Correctness**: 90/100  
- **Clarity**: 90/100  
- **Mean Score**: 86.67/100  

- **Justification**:  
The model-generated plan includes all essential steps for interacting with the cabinet and manipulating the object, but it introduces a step ("close the cabinet door") not described in the ground-truth plan. While closing the cabinet might logically follow opening it, the ground-truth plan prioritizes placing the object on the marker, which is a key part of the task. This omission affects **completeness** as the plan doesn't explicitly include the prescribed "put it on the marker" step.  

The steps in the plan follow a logically correct sequence, which boosts **correctness**, and each step is clear and suited for a low-level executor, thereby scoring well on **clarity**. However, the task goal does emphasize placing the object on the marker, which the model-generated plan fails to address.
