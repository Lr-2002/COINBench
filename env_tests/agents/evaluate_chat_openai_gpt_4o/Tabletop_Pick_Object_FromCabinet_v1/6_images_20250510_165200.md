# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Object-FromCabinet-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door 
Step 2: pick the object in the cabinet 
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick the apple to the marker
Step 2: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 57/100

## Justification
1. **Completeness**: The model-generated plan is missing essential steps required to achieve the task goal. Specifically, it skips opening the cabinet door and picking the object from the cabinet; instead, it erroneously starts with "pick the apple to the marker" without directly addressing the object retrieval from the cabinet.  
  2. **Correctness**: The plan is logically flawed as the order of instructions does not align with the task goal. Closing the cabinet door at the end assumes the object was retrieved, but the instruction flow does not demonstrate that event, violating logical sequence. 
  3. **Clarity**: While the individual instructions ("pick the apple to the marker" and "close the cabinet door") follow the low-level executor format and are clearly described, the lack of alignment with the task undermines overall clarity. Nonetheless, the steps themselves are understandable in isolation.

Thus, the plan partially satisfies clarity requirements but fails significantly in completeness and correctness, leading to a lower overall score.
