# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Object-FromCabinet-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door 
Step 2: pick the object in the cabinet 
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pick up the object from the cabinet
Step 3: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 88/100

## Justification
**  
  While the plan captures essential initial steps clearly and correctly, it introduces a non-essential step (closing the cabinet door) and fails to include the final task goal (placing the object on the marker), leading to a slight decline in completeness and correctness. Clarity remains high due to adherence to the low-level executor instruction format

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 90/100**  
  The model-generated plan includes critical steps (open cabinet door, pick up the object), but it adds an unnecessary step to *close the cabinet door*, diverting focus from the task goal (placing the object on the marker). It also omits placing the object on the marker, which is essential for completing the goal.

- **Correctness: 80/100**  
  The steps are logically ordered up to picking the object, but the addition of "close the cabinet door" disrupts alignment with the ground-truth task sequence where the focus should remain on placing the object on the marker after retrieval. Additionally, the inclusion deviates slightly from the expected simplification of the task execution.

- **Clarity: 95/100**  
  The steps are clearly described and conform to the format required by the low-level executor. The action-object instruction syntax is strictly followed, making it easy to understand and execute.

- **Mean Score: 88.3/100**  

- **Justification:**  
  While the plan captures essential initial steps clearly and correctly, it introduces a non-essential step (closing the cabinet door) and fails to include the final task goal (placing the object on the marker), leading to a slight decline in completeness and correctness. Clarity remains high due to adherence to the low-level executor instruction format.
