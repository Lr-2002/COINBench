# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Object-FromCabinet-v1 (8 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door 
Step 2: pick the object in the cabinet 
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick the apple to the marker
Step 2: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 56/100

## Justification
**  
  While the steps provided are phrased clearly, the plan lacks critical actions necessary to complete the entire task, skipping both the opening of the cabinet and picking the object. The sequence assumes preconditions (an open cabinet and the object’s accessibility) that are not guaranteed, reducing its correctness. Clarity compensates partially, as the language used is executable and precise

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 33/100**  
  The model-generated plan skips essential steps. It does not include opening the cabinet door or picking the object (it starts directly with placing the apple on the marker, assuming it’s already available). Key parts of the task are omitted.

- **Correctness: 50/100**  
  The two steps provided by the model are logical in isolation and in sequence, but the order assumes preconditions that are not satisfied (e.g., the cabinet being open or the object being accessible). Closing the cabinet door without ensuring all prior steps are complete may also imply a misunderstanding of task dependencies.

- **Clarity: 85/100**  
  The commands are clear, concise, and aligned with the format understandable by the low-level executor. However, the reference to "the apple" assumes context or prior knowledge that may not exist in this task environment.

- **Mean Score: 56/100**

- **Justification:**  
  While the steps provided are phrased clearly, the plan lacks critical actions necessary to complete the entire task, skipping both the opening of the cabinet and picking the object. The sequence assumes preconditions (an open cabinet and the object’s accessibility) that are not guaranteed, reducing its correctness. Clarity compensates partially, as the language used is executable and precise.
