# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Object-FromCabinet-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door 
Step 2: pick the object in the cabinet 
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: find and pick the object from the cabinet
Step 3: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 80/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 87/100

## Justification
**  
  The plan is close to being complete and logically ordered but diverges slightly from the ground truth by omitting the "put it on the marker" step and adding an unnecessary "close the cabinet door" action. Despite these issues, the steps are clear and executable by the low-level executor, resulting in high scores for correctness and clarity

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 80/100**  
  The model-generated plan includes essential steps to achieve the task goal, such as opening the cabinet door and picking the object. However, it does not explicitly include the step of putting the object on the marker, which is required to fulfill the goal. It adds an unnecessary step (closing the cabinet door) that is not mentioned in the goal or the ground-truth plan.

- **Correctness: 90/100**  
  The sequence of steps in the model-generated plan is logically correct and follows a sensible order. However, the added step (closing the cabinet door) is not part of the task goal and slightly deviates from a strictly correct interpretation of the instructions.

- **Clarity: 90/100**  
  The steps are described in clear and understandable language, and their format is compatible with the low-level executor's requirements. However, an unnecessary step ("close the cabinet door") introduces potential confusion about whether this action is part of the task.

- **Mean Score: 87/100**

- **Justification:**  
  The plan is close to being complete and logically ordered but diverges slightly from the ground truth by omitting the "put it on the marker" step and adding an unnecessary "close the cabinet door" action. Despite these issues, the steps are clear and executable by the low-level executor, resulting in high scores for correctness and clarity.
