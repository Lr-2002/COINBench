# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Object-FromCabinet-v1 (9 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door 
Step 2: pick the object in the cabinet 
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick the apple to the marker
Step 2: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan skips a critical step: opening the cabinet door. Without this, it would be impossible to retrieve the object from inside the cabinet, making the generated plan incomplete in addressing the entire task goal.  
  - **Correctness**: While the steps provided are logically sequenced (pick then close), the step to pick "the apple" is inconsistent with the ground-truth objective (to pick an unspecified object, not necessarily an apple). This suggests a misunderstanding of the task, although the sequence itself is valid based on the generated subtask.  
  - **Clarity**: The instructions are described using the expected format for the low-level executor. However, the generated plan's first step with "pick the apple to the marker" introduces a slight ambiguity, as "apple" might not align with the ground-truth task’s object of focus. Otherwise, the steps are easy to understand
