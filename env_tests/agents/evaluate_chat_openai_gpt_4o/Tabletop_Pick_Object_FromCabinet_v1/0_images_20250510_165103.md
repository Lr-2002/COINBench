# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Object-FromCabinet-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door 
Step 2: pick the object in the cabinet 
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: identify the object inside the cabinet
Step 3: pick up the identified object
Step 4: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 80/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 87/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes an additional step ("identify the object inside the cabinet") and a closing step ("close the cabinet door"), which are not strictly essential for the task goal. However, it omits the required action in the ground truth plan to explicitly "put it on the marker." This is a significant omission that impacts the task completion.

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 80/100  
- **Correctness**: 90/100  
- **Clarity**: 90/100  
- **Mean Score**: 87/100  
- **Justification**:  

  - **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes an additional step ("identify the object inside the cabinet") and a closing step ("close the cabinet door"), which are not strictly essential for the task goal. However, it omits the required action in the ground truth plan to explicitly "put it on the marker." This is a significant omission that impacts the task completion.  

  - **Correctness**: The sequence of the steps is logically correct and follows a proper order for operating the cabinet and picking the object. It doesnâ€™t introduce any illogical actions. However, the omission of placing the object on the marker makes the plan incomplete in achieving the task goal, slightly lowering the score.  

  - **Clarity**: The steps are described in clear and understandable terms, adhering to the low-level executor format. Instructions such as "open the cabinet door," "identify the object," and "pick up the identified object" are precise and executable. The clarity score is high.
