# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Object-FromCabinet-v1 (7 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door 
Step 2: pick the object in the cabinet 
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick the apple to the marker
Step 2: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan skips the critical step of opening the cabinet door, which is essential for accessing the object. Furthermore, the generated plan assumes the apple is already available to be picked up, but in reality, it is inside a closed cabinet. This omits an essential portion of the task, reducing the score significantly.  
  - **Correctness**: The order of actions is problematic. The generated plan starts with "pick the apple to the marker," which is logically impossible unless the cabinet is already open and the object (apple) has been retrieved. Furthermore, the generated plan closes the cabinet door after attempting to pick up the apple without confirming the accessibility of the object, making the sequence incorrect.  
  - **Clarity**: Though the individual steps in the model's plan ("pick the apple to the marker," "close the cabinet door") are written in proper low-level executor-compatible format, the description lacks sufficient logical connectiveness for performing the larger task goal within the benchmark environment. This score reflects only the clarity at the step level
