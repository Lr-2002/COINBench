# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Object-FromCabinet-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door 
Step 2: pick the object in the cabinet 
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick the apple to the marker
Step 2: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
**  
  - *Completeness:* The model-generated plan omits the crucial step of opening the cabinet door (if it wasn’t already open) and does not include picking up the object from the cabinet, which is the task goal. It assumes the apple is already accessible and directly places it on the marker, which only partially matches the task requirements.  
  - *Correctness:* The steps provided by the model are out of order in terms of logical sequence; closing the cabinet is inappropriate if it hasn’t been explicitly opened, which was a requirement in the ground-truth plan. Additionally, the task goal specifies retrieving an object *from the cabinet*, which is bypassed altogether. This sequence and logic deviate significantly from the goal.  
  - *Clarity:* Despite the gaps in steps and logic, the instructions are given in a clear format suitable for the low-level executor. Both steps adhere to the <action> the <object> format and are unambiguous, albeit inaccurate
