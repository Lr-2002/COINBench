# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Object-FromCabinet-v1 (10 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door 
Step 2: pick the object in the cabinet 
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick the apple to the marker
Step 2: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 30/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan fails to align well with the task goal and the ground-truth plan. It excludes critical steps (opening the cabinet and correctly picking up the object), resulting in a low score for completeness. While the individual instructions are clear, their logical arrangement is incorrect, and the steps are insufficient to accomplish the task

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 30/100**  
  The model-generated plan misses essential steps. It does not include the step to open the cabinet and pick up the object (assumed to be in the cabinet). The first step, "pick the apple to the marker," does not align logically with the task goal since the object is initially inside the cabinet.

- **Correctness: 40/100**  
  The order of the steps is flawed. The first step, "pick the apple to the marker," assumes that the object (apple) has already been picked and is accessible, which contradicts the task goal. Additionally, closing the cabinet door at the second step seems premature, as the high-level task goal of picking the object from the cabinet was not yet logically completed.

- **Clarity: 80/100**  
  The individual steps are written in a clear format understandable by a low-level executor. Each action adheres to the "<action> the <object>" format, and the instructions themselves are well-specified. However, the clarity does not compensate for the missing and out-of-sequence steps.

- **Mean Score: 50/100**  

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan fails to align well with the task goal and the ground-truth plan. It excludes critical steps (opening the cabinet and correctly picking up the object), resulting in a low score for completeness. While the individual instructions are clear, their logical arrangement is incorrect, and the steps are insufficient to accomplish the task.
