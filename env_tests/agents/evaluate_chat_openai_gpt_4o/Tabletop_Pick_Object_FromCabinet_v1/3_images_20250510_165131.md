# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Object-FromCabinet-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door 
Step 2: pick the object in the cabinet 
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: find and pick the object from the cabinet
Step 3: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 85/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 82/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes most essential steps but omits a critical final step from the task goal — to put the object on the marker. This makes the plan incomplete beyond fulfilling the cabinet interaction.  
  - **Correctness**: The sequence is logical (open the door, find and pick the object, close the door) but closing the cabinet door prematurely interferes with the main task goal, as putting the object on the marker would likely still require access to the cabinet.  
  - **Clarity**: The steps are clearly described, adhering well to the low-level executor's expected format. However, "find and pick the object from the cabinet" slightly deviates from the style of specificity required by the executor. A clearer instruction would be "pick the object in the cabinet."
