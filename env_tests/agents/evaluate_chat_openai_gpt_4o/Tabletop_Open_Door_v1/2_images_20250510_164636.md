## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 30/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 43/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan is highly incomplete. It skips essential preparatory steps such as positioning the robot arm and grasping the door handle, which are crucial for successfully executing the task. This severely reduces its score for completeness.  
  - **Correctness**: While "open the door" is logically correct as part of the final goal, the plan does not follow the correct sequential process described in the ground-truth plan. Missing prior steps makes it contextually flawed.  
  - **Clarity**: The instruction "open the door" is clear and aligns with the format required for the low-level executor. However, clarity suffers slightly due to the absence of details for intermediate actions
