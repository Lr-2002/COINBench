## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 33/100**  
The model-generated plan lacks the intermediate, essential steps required to achieve the task. Specifically, it skips positioning the robot arm and grasping the door handle, directly jumping to the final action of opening the door. 

- **Correctness: 40/100**  
While "open the door" is an essential step and logically fits the task, the omission of prior sequential actions (position the robot arm, grasp the handle) makes the plan incomplete and incorrect in terms of order. Those steps must precede opening the door for the task to be executed properly.

- **Clarity: 70/100**  
The step "open the door" is concise and presented in a format understandable for a low-level executor. However, it lacks explicit instructions required to cover the entire task.

- **Mean Score: 48/100**  
(33 + 40 + 70) รท 3 = **48**

- **Justification:**  
The model-generated plan oversimplifies the task, omitting crucial preparatory steps essential for both completeness and correctness. While the final step is clear and written in an executor-friendly format, the lack of intermediate actions severely diminishes the overall quality of the plan.
