# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Open-Door-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: position the robot arm in front of the door
Step 2: grasp the door handle
Step 3: pull the door open
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: locate the door
Step 2: open the door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
- *Completeness*: The model-generated plan is missing essential steps present in the ground-truth plan, such as positioning the robot arm in front of the door and grasping the door handle. These are vital intermediate steps for the execution of "open the door," so the plan is only partially complete.  
  - *Correctness*: While "locate the door" and "open the door" are logically correct steps, the lack of clear intermediate steps such as "grasp the handle" and "pull the door open" means the sequence is incomplete. Furthermore, "open the door" is too abstract for a low-level executor to understand, lacking the explicit actions required in this task.  
  - *Clarity*: Instructions like "open the door" are high-level and lack the granularity required for a low-level executor to perform specific actions. The human-annotated steps provide much greater clarity with explicit references to precise actions like "grasp the door handle" and "pull the door open."
