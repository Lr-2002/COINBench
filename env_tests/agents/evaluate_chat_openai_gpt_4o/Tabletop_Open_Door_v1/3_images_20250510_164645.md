## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 47/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan lacks several essential intermediate steps (e.g., positioning the arm and grasping the door handle), which significantly diminishes its **completeness score**. While "open the door" is logically correct within the task context, the lack of sequential details makes this a poor representation of the required actions, reducing its **correctness** score. However, the action "open the door" is phrased clearly and aligns with the low-level executor's instruction set, resulting in a decent **clarity** score
