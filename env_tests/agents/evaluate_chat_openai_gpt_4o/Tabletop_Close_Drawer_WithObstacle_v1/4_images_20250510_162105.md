# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Close-Drawer-WithObstacle-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pull the obstacle
Step 3: close the cabinet
Step 4: close the drawer
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: close the drawer
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 25/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 48/100

## Justification
- **Completeness (25/100):** The model-generated plan is incomplete since it skips essential steps like opening the cabinet door, moving the obstacle, and closing the cabinet before attempting to close the drawer. These are necessary for completing the task goal successfully.  
  - **Correctness (30/100):** The single step "close the drawer" is correct and sequential within itself, but the overall order of operations is invalid as key prerequisites are missed. For example, without handling the obstacle, the drawer cannot be properly closed.  
  - **Clarity (90/100):** The single instruction, "close the drawer," is clear and easily understandable for the low-level executor. It aligns well with the specified instruction format.
