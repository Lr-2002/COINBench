# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Close-Drawer-WithObstacle-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pull the obstacle
Step 3: close the cabinet
Step 4: close the drawer
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Approach the drawer handle.
Step 2: Grasp the drawer handle securely.
Step 3: Push the drawer inward to close it.
Step 4: Release the drawer handle.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 25/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 40/100
- Mean Score: 32/100

## Justification
- **Completeness:** The model-generated plan fails to consider essential prerequisite steps (like dealing with the obstacle and the cabinet) before closing the drawer, which are described in the ground-truth plan. This omission severely impacts the completeness.  
  - **Correctness:** The model-generated steps for closing the drawer are plausibly logical and sequential but neglect the critical dependency of addressing obstacles from the ground-truth plan. Hence, correctness is higher than completeness but still significantly flawed.  
  - **Clarity:** While the model-generated plan's instructions for closing the drawer are relatively clear and follow the low-level instruction format, they do not account for all aspects of the task context, which reduces its clarity
