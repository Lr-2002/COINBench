# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Close-Drawer-WithObstacle-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pull the obstacle
Step 3: close the cabinet
Step 4: close the drawer
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: grasp the handle of the drawer
Step 2: push the drawer inward to close it
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
** While the model-generated plan offers clear instructions for closing the drawer, it lacks completeness and broader correctness relative to the task requirements. It assumes prior subtask completion and does not include steps for handling the obstacle, as specified in the ground-truth plan

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 40/100**  
  The model-generated plan omits essential steps required to achieve the task in the presence of an obstacle (e.g., opening the cabinet, removing the obstacle, and closing the cabinet). It only addresses closing the drawer, which is insufficient for the full task.

- **Correctness: 50/100**  
  The steps provided are logically valid only for the specific sub-scenario where the obstacle has already been removed, but they fail to account for the sequential actions necessary in the benchmark environment as described in the ground-truth plan. The ordering of the actions is correct within its scope, but the broader task sequence is incomplete.

- **Clarity: 70/100**  
  The instructions are clear and formatted appropriately for a low-level executor, adhering to "<action> the <object>" conventions. However, the lack of sufficient context about handling the obstacle reduces overall clarity for executing the full task goal.

- **Mean Score: 53.33/100**  
  **Justification:** While the model-generated plan offers clear instructions for closing the drawer, it lacks completeness and broader correctness relative to the task requirements. It assumes prior subtask completion and does not include steps for handling the obstacle, as specified in the ground-truth plan.
