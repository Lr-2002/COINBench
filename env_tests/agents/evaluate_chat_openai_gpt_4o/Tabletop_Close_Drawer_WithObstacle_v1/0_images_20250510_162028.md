# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Close-Drawer-WithObstacle-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pull the obstacle
Step 3: close the cabinet
Step 4: close the drawer
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: close the drawer
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 25/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 42/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan only includes the final step (“close the drawer”) while missing essential prerequisite steps such as opening the cabinet, pulling the obstacle, and closing the cabinet. This omission leaves out 75% of the important steps from the ground-truth plan.  
  - **Correctness:** Despite being logically possible to "close the drawer," this step is out of order, as the obstacle would make closing the drawer infeasible without performing earlier steps (like moving the obstacle). This indicates a lack of logical sequencing.  
  - **Clarity:** The single step provided is written clearly and aligns with the low-level executor's expected format. However, since context for earlier steps is missing, the clarity is diminished slightly
