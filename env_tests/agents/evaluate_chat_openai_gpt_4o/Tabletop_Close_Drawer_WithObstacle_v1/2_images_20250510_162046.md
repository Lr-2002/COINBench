# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Close-Drawer-WithObstacle-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pull the obstacle
Step 3: close the cabinet
Step 4: close the drawer
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: close the drawer
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 25/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 55/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan is concise and clear but omits critical steps necessary to achieve the task goal. Skipping steps like handling the obstacle renders the execution incomplete and potentially infeasible. While the single included action is clear and appropriately formatted, the plan fails significantly in completeness and correctness

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 25/100**  
  The model-generated plan misses essential steps required to complete the task, as it skips handling the obstacle entirely (e.g., opening the cabinet door, pulling the obstacle, and closing the cabinet). It only includes the final step, "close the drawer."

- **Correctness: 50/100**  
  While the step "close the drawer" is logically part of the overall task and appears in the correct sequence after all the missed steps, executing it independently without addressing the obstacle first makes the order incomplete and logically incorrect in the larger context.

- **Clarity: 90/100**  
  The step "close the drawer" is simple, specific, and adheres to the format necessary for the low-level executor. It is clearly described and easy to understand.

- **Mean Score: 55/100**

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan is concise and clear but omits critical steps necessary to achieve the task goal. Skipping steps like handling the obstacle renders the execution incomplete and potentially infeasible. While the single included action is clear and appropriately formatted, the plan fails significantly in completeness and correctness.
