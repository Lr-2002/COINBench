## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 25/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 38/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan lacks essential steps (such as opening the cabinet door, pulling the obstacle, and closing the cabinet) to successfully complete the task. It only specifies the final step, so the score reflects the significant omissions.  
  - **Correctness**: The single step provided ("close the drawer") is logically valid on its own but fails to consider the prerequisite steps, making the sequential logic incomplete and improper. 
  - **Clarity**: The single provided step is expressed clearly and in a format understandable by a low-level executor, which gives this criterion a higher score. However, since only one step is described, it does not account for more complex understanding
