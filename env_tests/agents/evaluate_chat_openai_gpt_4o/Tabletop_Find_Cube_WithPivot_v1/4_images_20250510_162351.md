# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Cube-WithPivot-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put the left cube on the pivot
Step 2: put the right cube on the pivot
Step 3: find the heavy cube and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 2: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 3: move the holder to the target marker
Step 4: release the cube into the goal region
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan is incomplete compared to the ground-truth because it omits critical steps (e.g., manipulating multiple cubes and placing the heavy cube on the marker). Although the sequence presented is logical, it does not align fully with the task goal or the ground-truth plan, reducing correctness. Clarity is decent because the low-level commands are actionable, but the lack of context about necessary subtasks limits clarity for achieving the full goal

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness:** 50/100  
The model-generated plan lacks essential steps included in the ground-truth plan. Specifically, the ground-truth plan mentions tasks related to identifying and manipulating specific cubes (e.g., putting the left/right/identified heavy cube on the pivot and marker). The model-generated plan focuses on rotating and moving a single cube to the goal region but does not address all required subtasks from the objective or ground-truth plan.  

- **Correctness:** 40/100  
The action sequence in the model-generated plan has logical steps of manipulation (rotation, placement, moving the holder, and releasing the cube). However, it does not correspond to the required steps outlined in the ground-truth plan, such as identifying and positioning multiple cubes on the pivot and marker. The logical order does not match the task goal correctly.  

- **Clarity:** 70/100  
The instructions are sufficiently clear for a low-level executor, as steps are described in a format compatible with robot-level commands. For example, "rotate the cube till the blue face upward" and "pick up the cube, put it in the holder" are clear and actionable. However, the plan does not provide clarity about the need for multiple cubes or other essential manipulations.  

- **Mean Score:** 53.33/100  

- **Justification:**  
The model-generated plan is incomplete compared to the ground-truth because it omits critical steps (e.g., manipulating multiple cubes and placing the heavy cube on the marker). Although the sequence presented is logical, it does not align fully with the task goal or the ground-truth plan, reducing correctness.
