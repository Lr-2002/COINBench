# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Cube-WithPivot-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put the left cube on the pivot
Step 2: put the right cube on the pivot
Step 3: find the heavy cube and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 3: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 4: move the holder to the target area
Step 5: place the cube in the goal region
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 43/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The essential steps in the ground-truth plan (e.g., placing the left and right cubes on the pivot, identifying the heavy cube, and placing it on the marker) are not fully addressed in the model-generated plan. The model’s plan involves unrelated actions, such as rotating the holder and moving the cube, which do not accomplish the task's overall goal. Hence, it only partially aligns with the goal, resulting in a low score.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan is logically consistent with its own steps. However, the actions stray significantly from the prescribed ground-truth task, making them irrelevant to the task goal. Moreover, completing unrelated substeps in this order fails to align with the task sequence outlined in the ground truth. This results in a low correctness score.  
  - **Clarity:** The model-generated steps are expressed clearly and in executable terms for the low-level executor (e.g., "rotate the holder till the hole upward"). However, the described actions do not align with the task and may confuse the executor, reducing overall clarity
