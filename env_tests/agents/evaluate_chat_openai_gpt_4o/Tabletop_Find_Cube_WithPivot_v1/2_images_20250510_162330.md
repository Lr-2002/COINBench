# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Cube-WithPivot-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put the left cube on the pivot
Step 2: put the right cube on the pivot
Step 3: find the heavy cube and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 4: stack all the cube
Step 5: pull the pivot to the target area
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan includes steps relating to manipulating cubes and the pivot, but it misses essential steps in the Ground-Truth Plan, such as "find the heavy cube and put it on the marker." Only partial subtasks are covered, making it incomplete.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence of actions does not align logically with the Ground-Truth Plan. For example, the model performs actions like "rotate the holder till the hole upward" and "rotate the cube till the blue face upward," which are irrelevant to the task goal. The order also deviates from the logical flow needed for solving the task.  
  - **Clarity:** The steps are described in a clear, low-level format compatible with the executor's requirements. However, the unnecessary inclusion of unrelated steps reduces the overall clarity of the plan in terms of understanding the task goal
