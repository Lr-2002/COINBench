# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Cube-WithPivot-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put the left cube on the pivot
Step 2: put the right cube on the pivot
Step 3: find the heavy cube and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 4: stack all the cube
Step 5: move the stacked cube to the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 65/100
- Mean Score: 52/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan demonstrates partial relevance to cube manipulation but fails to fully capture and address the task goal outlined in the ground-truth plan (using a pivot to locate the heavy cube and place it on the marker). While the step descriptions are clear, the deviation from the proper task sequence significantly impacts both completeness and correctness

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 40/100  
The model-generated plan includes some actions related to cube manipulation, but it overlooks critical instructions in the ground-truth plan. For example, it does not address the use of a pivot to find the heavy cube or provide essential specifications for identifying and handling the cubes as described in the task goal.

- **Correctness**: 50/100  
The steps in the model-generated plan form a logical sequence for general cube manipulation but deviate significantly from the ground-truth trajectory. The steps fail to align with the primary task goal (finding the heavy cube). Instead, they seem focused on stacking and moving cubes, which may not satisfy the task requirements properly.

- **Clarity**: 65/100  
The instructions provided in the model-generated plan are fairly clear and understandable for a low-level executor. They adhere to the required action-object format. However, due to the deviation from the intended task, the plan lacks clarity in how these actions fulfill the actual goal (Tabletop-Find-Cube-WithPivot-v1).

- **Mean Score**: 52/100  

- **Justification**:  
The model-generated plan demonstrates partial relevance to cube manipulation but fails to fully capture and address the task goal outlined in the ground-truth plan (using a pivot to locate the heavy cube and place it on the marker). While the step descriptions are clear, the deviation from the proper task sequence significantly impacts both completeness and correctness.
