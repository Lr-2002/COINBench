# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Cube-WithPivot-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put the left cube on the pivot
Step 2: put the right cube on the pivot
Step 3: find the heavy cube and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 4: stack all the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan is incomplete. It does not include the essential steps of placing the left and right cubes on the pivot, nor does it address finding the heavy cube and placing it on the marker. It focuses on unrelated subtasks, leaving out critical parts of the goal (e.g., the task involving pivots and markers).  
  - **Correctness**: While the sequence within the model-generated plan is logically coherent and correctly ordered for handling cubes and a holder, it diverges significantly from the task's requirements. Therefore, it only partially aligns logically with the task's broader goal.  
  - **Clarity**: The instructions in the model-generated plan are relatively clear and align well with what a low-level executor can handle (e.g., "pick up the cube, put it in the holder" is clear and actionable). However, since the steps are unrelated to the task goal, clarity is diminished in context
