# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Cube-WithPivot-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put the left cube on the pivot
Step 2: put the right cube on the pivot
Step 3: find the heavy cube and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 4: stack all the cube
Step 5: move the cube to the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan shows some logical execution steps with clear language but diverges significantly from the ground-truth plan in terms of task completeness and correctness. Notably, the pivot mechanism and the distinction between the left, right, and heavy cubes are omitted, making the plan significantly incomplete and partially incorrect for achieving the task goal

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness:** 50/100  
  The model-generated plan mentions actions related to handling cubes but lacks explicit steps for manipulating the left, right, and heavy cubes in the way described in the ground-truth plan. The essential goal of using the pivot is omitted. Additionally, it does not distinguish between the left and right cubes, nor does it address specifically finding the heavy cube and putting it on the marker. These omissions make the plan partly incomplete.

- **Correctness:** 60/100  
  While the model-generated actions appear logically sequential for handling cubes, they do not follow the specific order or logic intended in the ground-truth plan. For example, using the pivot is integral to the task goal but is completely excluded. Instead, unrelated actions such as rotating cubes and stacking all cubes are added, which dilutes the correctness relative to the task goal.

- **Clarity:** 70/100  
  The instructions are fairly clear and executable in their low-level format. Actions such as "rotate the holder till the hole upward" and "stack all the cube" are precise. However, the lack of clarity regarding the intended goal (e.g., identifying and working with specific cubes and use of the pivot) reduces alignment with the task's requirements.

- **Mean Score:** 60/100  

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan shows some logical execution steps with clear language but diverges significantly from the ground-truth plan in terms of task completeness and correctness. Notably, the pivot mechanism and the distinction between the left, right, and heavy cubes are omitted, making the plan significantly incomplete and partially incorrect for achieving the task goal.
