# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Cube-WithPivot-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put the left cube on the pivot
Step 2: put the right cube on the pivot
Step 3: find the heavy cube and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: locate the cube and assess its orientation.
Step 2: pick up the cube.
Step 3: rotate the cube till the blue face upward (if needed).
Step 4: put the cube in the holder (if required by the goal region).
Step 5: rotate the holder till the hole upward (if required by the goal region).
Step 6: place the cube in the goal region.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 55/100
- Mean Score: 58/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan diverges significantly from the task goal outlined in the ground-truth plan. While some steps are logical and clear, key actions related to the pivot and identifying specific cubes (especially the heavy cube) are omitted, reducing completeness. The conditional phrasing introduces ambiguity, affecting clarity. Ultimately, the model-generated plan only partially aligns with the ground-truth trajectory and task requirements, leading to an average rating

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 50/100**  
The model-generated plan misses essential steps described in the ground-truth plan, particularly the actions of putting the left and right cubes on the pivot. While it includes steps for manipulating a cube and placing it in a goal region, the full task of handling multiple cubes and identifying the heavy cube is not addressed.

- **Correctness: 70/100**  
The sequence of steps in the model-generated plan is mostly logical and follows a sequential order appropriate for low-level manipulation goals. However, some steps (e.g., "put the cube in the holder" or "rotate the holder till the hole upward") appear to be overly conditional and not necessarily tied to the task objective specified in the ground-truth plan. Also, this sequence does not clearly correspond to identifying and handling the heavy cube.

- **Clarity: 55/100**  
While individual steps are described in an understandable format for a low-level executor, the plan is somewhat cluttered with conditional steps like "if required by the goal region," which could introduce ambiguity for execution. The focus of the planâ€™s instructions does not clearly match the task goal of finding and handling cubes, particularly identifying the heavy cube.
