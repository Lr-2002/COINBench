# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-WithOrientation-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the stick along y-axis
Step 2: insert it to the hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: pick up the board and insert it into the holder
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan fails to align with the essential steps of the ground-truth plan in terms of content and sequence, leading to poor Completeness and Correctness scores. Clarity is moderately rated because the steps themselves are syntactically clear but do not reflect the task's goal. Overall, the plan does not effectively fulfill the requirements of the given task

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 50/100**  
  The model-generated plan does not cover the essential step of rotating the stick along the y-axis as described in the ground-truth plan for the task. Instead, it introduces steps irrelevant to the described goal (e.g., involving a board and holder). Essential steps like "insert it to the hole" are also missing or different.

- **Correctness: 40/100**  
  The logical sequence and correctness of the steps are off compared to the ground-truth plan. The first step, "rotate the holder till the hole upward," does not align with the provided goal's requirements. Furthermore, the mention of a "board" and "holder" deviates from the expected manipulation of the stick, demonstrating a misunderstanding or misalignment with the task's logic.

- **Clarity: 60/100**  
  The model-generated steps are clear in terms of formatting and can be executed by a low-level executor. However, the instructions relate to a different object and action sequence ("board and holder" instead of "stick and hole"), which reduces the clarity regarding the actual task goal.

- **Mean Score: 50/100**  

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan fails to align with the essential steps of the ground-truth plan in terms of content and sequence, leading to poor Completeness and Correctness scores. Clarity is moderately rated because the steps themselves are syntactically clear but do not reflect the task's goal. Overall, the plan does not effectively fulfill the requirements of the given task.
