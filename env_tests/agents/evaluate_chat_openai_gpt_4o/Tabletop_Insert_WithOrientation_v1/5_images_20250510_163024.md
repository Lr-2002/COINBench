# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-WithOrientation-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the stick along y-axis
Step 2: insert it to the hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 3: rotate the USB body for 90 degree with plug right ward
Step 4: pull the pivot to the target area
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes several steps, but it deviates significantly from the ground-truth plan. Essential steps for achieving the goal, such as explicitly rotating the stick along the y-axis and inserting it into the hole, are omitted or misinterpreted. This omission significantly reduces its completeness.  
  - **Correctness**: The steps in the model-generated plan are mostly unrelated to the task goal and appear logically incorrect in the given order. For example, rotating the holder till the hole upward and picking up the cube do not align logically to achieve the Tabletop-Insert-WithOrientation task, which requires manipulating a stick and inserting it into a hole.  
  - **Clarity**: While the individual steps are described in clear terms suitable for a low-level executor, their inclusion in the plan does not make the task goal comprehensible. The model-generated plan fails to align with the task context, which impacts both clarity and relevance
