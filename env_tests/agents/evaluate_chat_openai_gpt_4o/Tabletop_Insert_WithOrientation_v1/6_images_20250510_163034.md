# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-WithOrientation-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the stick along y-axis
Step 2: insert it to the hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: pick up the board and insert it into the holder
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 25/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 45/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan deviates from the given task steps, failing to include all essential actions needed to fulfill the ground-truth goal (e.g., no mention of rotating the stick along the y-axis as required). The instruction about the holder is unrelated to the expected actions described in the ground-truth plan. Hence, the score is reduced significantly but not zero since there is some attempt at action planning.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence of steps outlined in the model-generated plan does not logically or sequentially align with the ground-truth task. The action "rotate the holder till the hole upward" does not match the task goal, and the object "board" referenced seems inconsistent with the "stick" in the ground truth. These logical inconsistencies significantly impact the score.  
  - **Clarity:** While the steps are presented in a structurally clear manner and adhere to the low-level executor instruction format, the task goal is mismatched, causing confusion. However, if assessed independently, the syntax and clarity of instructions like "rotate the holder till the hole upward" are understandable, achieving a decent score for clarity
