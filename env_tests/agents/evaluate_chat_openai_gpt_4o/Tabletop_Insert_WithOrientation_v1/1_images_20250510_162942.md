# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-WithOrientation-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the stick along y-axis
Step 2: insert it to the hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: pick up the board
Step 3: insert the board into the holder
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits key task-specific actions from the ground truth, leading to a significant reduction in the score.
- **Correctness**: The logical flow and relevance of steps are poor, with extraneous actions included and essential ones omitted.
- **Clarity**: While the steps are grammatically correct and well-specified for the low-level executor format, the lack of task relevance reduces overall clarity

### Evaluation of Model-Generated Plan:

#### Completeness: 50/100
The ground-truth plan specifies two essential steps related to the task: rotating the stick along the y-axis and inserting it into the hole. The model-generated plan partially addresses the insertion goal but fails to include the critical action of rotating the stick. Instead, it includes unrelated or unnecessary actions (e.g., picking up the board). While it identifies actions related to insertion, it misses essential context from the ground-truth steps.

#### Correctness: 40/100
The sequence of steps in the model-generated plan is logically flawed for the task as described by the ground-truth plan. Rotating "the holder till the hole upward" or picking up "the board" are not directly relevant to the provided task or consistent with the ground-truth context. Furthermore, the described sequence does not align logically with the completion of the intended tabletop-insertion task.

#### Clarity: 70/100
The steps in the model-generated plan are clear and formatted correctly for the low-level executor. Each action follows the "<action> <object>" template and is understandable. However, due to the inclusion of irrelevant actions and their lack of alignment with the task goal, the clarity suffers in terms of conveying the intended task.

#### Mean Score: 53/100

#### Justification:
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits key task-specific actions from the ground truth, leading to a significant reduction in the score.
- **Correctness**: The logical flow and relevance of steps are poor, with extraneous actions included and essential ones omitted.
- **Clarity**: While the steps are grammatically correct and well-specified for the low-level executor format, the lack of task relevance reduces overall clarity.
