# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-WithOrientation-v1 (8 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the stick along y-axis
Step 2: insert it to the hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the USB body for 90 degree with plug right ward
Step 2: pull the pivot to the target area
Step 3: ensure the pivot is securely inserted
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan deviates from the ground-truth plan. While it includes "pull the pivot to the target area" and "ensure the pivot is securely inserted," which are somewhat related, it doesn't describe "rotate the stick along y-axis," which is a crucial first step in the ground-truth plan. This omission reduces completeness.  
  - **Correctness**: The steps are not logically aligned with the goal of "Tabletop-Insert-WithOrientation-v1." Specifically, the model instruction "rotate the USB body for 90 degree with plug right ward" appears irrelevant to the task, and the sequential order does not properly represent the correct manipulation trajectory (rotating first, then inserting).  
  - **Clarity**: The instructions use clear language and are properly formatted for execution by the low-level executor. However, some steps ("rotate the USB body for 90 degree with plug right ward") seem ambiguous or unnecessary in the context, lowering clarity slightly
