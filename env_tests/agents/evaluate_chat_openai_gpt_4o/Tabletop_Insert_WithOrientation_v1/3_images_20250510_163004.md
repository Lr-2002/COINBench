# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-WithOrientation-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the stick along y-axis
Step 2: insert it to the hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the board till the correct alignment with the holder
Step 2: insert the board into the holder
Step 3: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 4: finalize the position of the board on the wall
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: While the model-generated plan includes multiple steps, it introduces unnecessary actions, such as rotating the board or finalizing the position, which are not part of the original task. Additionally, the model plan does not make clear that the stick (or object) must be rotated along a specific axis (y-axis). Thus, the plan diverges from including only essential steps for this task.

- **Completeness**: 70/100  
- **Correctness**: 50/100

- **Justification**:  

  - **Completeness**: While the model-generated plan includes multiple steps, it introduces unnecessary actions, such as rotating the board or finalizing the position, which are not part of the original task. Additionally, the model plan does not make clear that the stick (or object) must be rotated along a specific axis (y-axis). Thus, the plan diverges from including only essential steps for this task.  

  - **Correctness**: The steps in the model-generated plan are out of sequence compared to the ground-truth task: it introduces unrelated actions before the final insertion step. Additionally, the logical flow of the original task (rotating and then inserting the stick) is altered with irrelevant and unnecessary steps, which makes the sequence less correct overall.  

  - **Clarity**: While some of the steps in the model-generated plan are clear individually, the phrasing of steps like "rotate the board till the correct alignment with the holder" is ambiguousâ€”it's unclear what "correct alignment" means for the low-level executor. Furthermore, phrases like "finalize the position of the board on the wall" are not task-specific and do not align with the action instructions that the executor would expect, making the overall instructions less executable.
