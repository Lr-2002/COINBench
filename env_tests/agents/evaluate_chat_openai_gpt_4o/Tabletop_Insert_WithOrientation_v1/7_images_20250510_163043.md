# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-WithOrientation-v1 (7 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the stick along y-axis
Step 2: insert it to the hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: rotate the USB body for 90 degree with plug right ward
Step 3: pull the pivot to the target area
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan diverges from the ground-truth plan significantly. For completeness, it includes three steps, but some seem irrelevant or excessively detailed, and the actual "insert into hole" step is missing. For correctness, the sequence of tasks is illogical and does not align with the task goal; the steps are out of order and not appropriate for tabletop insertions. Clarity is relatively high since actions are described in a way that a low-level executor can understand, but the clarity does not compensate for the incorrectness and incompleteness. Overall, the mean score reflects the significant deficiencies in task execution relative to the ground-truth plan
