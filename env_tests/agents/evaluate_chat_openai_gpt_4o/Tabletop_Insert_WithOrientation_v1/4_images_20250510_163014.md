# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-WithOrientation-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the stick along y-axis
Step 2: insert it to the hole
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: insert the board into the holder
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 47/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan misses the first critical step from the ground-truth plan: "rotate the stick along the y-axis." Instead, it introduces "rotate the holder till the hole upward," which is a distinct and unrelated action. The second step in the model's plan, "insert the board into the holder," deviates from the specified steps in the ground-truth plan. Thus, the essential action of correctly preparing the object orientation (rotating the stick) is omitted, resulting in incompleteness.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence of steps is incorrect and not logically aligned with the task goal. The object manipulation described in the generated plan (rotating holder and inserting a board) is wrong compared to the requirement in the ground truth (rotating the stick and inserting it into a hole). Moreover, the task's fundamental logic—preparing and inserting the correct object—is violated, significantly lowering correctness.  
  - **Clarity:** While the individual steps in the generated plan are clear and adhere to the low-level executor's instruction format, the generated steps misinterpret the task. This interpretation issue affects the plan's overall intention clarity. Despite this, the commands themselves ("rotate the holder" and "insert the board into the holder") are syntactically understandable
