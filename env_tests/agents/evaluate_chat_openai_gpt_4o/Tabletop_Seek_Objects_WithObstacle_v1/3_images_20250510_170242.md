# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-WithObstacle-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: pick the cube
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: locate the cube inside the cabinet
Step 3: pick up the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 95/100
- Clarity: 100/100
- Mean Score: 95/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan is partially complete but misses the final goal of the ground-truth plan, resulting in a slight penalty for completeness. Logical ordering of steps and clarity are excellent, as the steps accurately and clearly guide the robot in a way the low-level executor can interpret

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 90/100**  
  The model-generated plan includes essential steps relevant to the task goal, but it doesn't complete the full goal described in the ground-truth plan (e.g., placing the cube on the marker is missing). It covers actions up to picking up the cube, but fails to address the final step.

- **Correctness: 95/100**  
  The actions in the model-generated plan are logically and sequentially correct. "Open the cabinet door" is a valid initial step, followed by locating and picking the cube, which progresses the task correctly. However, since it stops short and doesn't include "put it on the marker" as a step, there is a slight gap in the overall logical sequence.

- **Clarity: 100/100**  
  The steps in the generated plan are described clearly and adhere perfectly to the low-level executor's requirements. Each action is explicit, understandable, and in the correct format.

- **Mean Score: 95/100**  
  (90 + 95 + 100) / 3 = 95  

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan is partially complete but misses the final goal of the ground-truth plan, resulting in a slight penalty for completeness. Logical ordering of steps and clarity are excellent, as the steps accurately and clearly guide the robot in a way the low-level executor can interpret.
