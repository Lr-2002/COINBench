## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 67/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 72/100

## Justification
**Completeness**: The model-generated plan lacks the final step ("put it on the marker") required to fully achieve the task goal, missing an essential part of the task.  
  **Correctness**: While the steps provided are logically accurate and sequentially correct for part of the task (opening the cabinet door and then picking up the cube), it seems to misrepresent "open the cabinet door" instead of "open the door," which might hint at a misunderstanding or contextual mismatch. Despite this, the steps align within their subset.  
  **Clarity**: The model-generated plan uses clear and actionable instructions suitable for a low-level executor but includes a small ambiguity about the "door" being specified as a "cabinet door." Overall, it is understandable
