## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 67/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan is incomplete as it omits the necessary action of opening the door. While the single step present is logically sound and clearly stated, the lack of essential preceding steps makes the plan insufficient for successful task execution

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 50/100**  
  The model-generated plan is missing the essential step "open the door" before picking the cube. Although it includes "pick the cube," it doesn't account for the obstacle (the door), which is required to complete the task successfully.    

- **Correctness: 60/100**  
  The single step "pick up the cube" is logically correct but out of order. The cube cannot be picked up without first opening the door. Sequential logic is violated because the prerequisite step is missing.   

- **Clarity: 90/100**  
  The instruction "pick up the cube" is clear and adheres to the low-level executor format. However, the lack of other steps reduces overall clarity in execution context.    

- **Mean Score: 66.67/100**  
   
- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan is incomplete as it omits the necessary action of opening the door. While the single step present is logically sound and clearly stated, the lack of essential preceding steps makes the plan insufficient for successful task execution.
