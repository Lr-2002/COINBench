# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-WithObstacle-v1 (7 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: pick the cube
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pick up the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 85/100

## Justification
**  
  The plan is physically and logically correct for the subset of steps described, and the instructions are clear. However, the omission of the final "put it on the marker" step reduces its completeness score. The high clarity score reflects the plan's adherence to the required low-level executor format

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 70/100**  
  The model-generated plan is missing the final step present in the ground-truth plan: "put it on the marker." While it addresses the initial subtasks ("open the cabinet door" and "pick up the cube"), the task goal is incomplete without placing the cube on the marker.

- **Correctness: 90/100**  
  The steps included are logically correct and sequentialâ€”opening the cabinet door is necessary before picking up the cube. The order matches expectations, but the omission of the final step leaves the task partially incomplete.

- **Clarity: 95/100**  
  The model-generated steps are clear, concise, and understandable for a low-level executor. The phrasing ("open the cabinet door" and "pick up the cube") adheres to the required action-object format.

- **Mean Score: 85/100**  

- **Justification:**  
  The plan is physically and logically correct for the subset of steps described, and the instructions are clear. However, the omission of the final "put it on the marker" step reduces its completeness score. The high clarity score reflects the plan's adherence to the required low-level executor format.
