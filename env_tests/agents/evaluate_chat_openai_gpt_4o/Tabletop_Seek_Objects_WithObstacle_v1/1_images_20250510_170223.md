# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-WithObstacle-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: pick the cube
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: find and pick up the cube from the cabinet
Step 3: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 95/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 93/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness (95):** The model-generated plan successfully covers all essential actions needed to achieve the task goal, assuming the cube is inside a cabinet (not detailed in the ground-truth plan). However, the explicit instruction to "put it on the marker" is omitted, making it less complete compared to the ground-truth plan.  
  - **Correctness (90):** The steps are logically and sequentially correct, reflecting a coherent order that handles the task appropriately (open the cabinet, pick up the cube, close the cabinet). However, there is a small discrepancy between the input environment assumptions, as the ground-truth plan assumes the cube to be observable on the tabletop. This may cause contextual confusion.  
  - **Clarity (95):** The steps are described in the "low-level executor"-compliant structure, making them clear and understandable. The instructions (“open the cabinet door,” “find and pick up the cube from the cabinet,” “close the cabinet door”) adhere well to the required format, providing precision for execution
