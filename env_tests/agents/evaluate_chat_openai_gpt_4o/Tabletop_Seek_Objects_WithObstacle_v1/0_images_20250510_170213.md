## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: pick the cube
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: locate the cube inside the cabinet
Step 3: pick up the cube
Step 4: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 85/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 90/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan is detailed and follows a logical sequence, but it is incomplete as it does not finish the task goal of placing the cube on the marker. While the clarity of the steps is excellent and easily interpretable by the low-level executor, the omission of a crucial step impacts the overall score

### Evaluation of Model-Generated Plan:

- **Completeness: 85/100**  
  The model-generated plan includes additional details, such as opening and closing the cabinet door, and locating the cube inside the cabinet, which are potentially useful steps depending on the task's context. However, it misses the final step of placing the cube on the marker, which is an essential part of the task goal.  

- **Correctness: 90/100**  
  The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan is logical and follows a natural order. Opening the cabinet door, locating the cube, picking it up, and then closing the cabinet door are all steps that make sense in performing the task. However, the omission of placing the cube on the marker slightly affects the correctness since this final step is crucial to meeting the task goal.  

- **Clarity: 95/100**  
  The steps are clearly described, and all actions are understandable for the low-level executor. Each step uses an acceptable format for the executor, making the instructions implementable without confusion.  

- **Mean Score: 90/100**  

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan is detailed and follows a logical sequence, but it is incomplete as it does not finish the task goal of placing the cube on the marker. While the clarity of the steps is excellent and easily interpretable by the low-level executor, the omission of a crucial step impacts the overall score.
