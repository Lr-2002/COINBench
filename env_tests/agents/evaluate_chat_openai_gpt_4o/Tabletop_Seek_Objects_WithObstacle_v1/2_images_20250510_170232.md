# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-WithObstacle-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: pick the cube
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: find the cube in the cabinet
Step 3: pick up the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 88/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model plan provides necessary steps but overlooks the "put it on the marker" task from the ground-truth plan, which means the task isn't fully completed. However, it includes finding the cube, which adds helpful context, earning a comparatively high score.  
  - **Correctness:** The model plan's steps are logical and sequential overall, but the modification "find the cube in the cabinet" deviates slightly since the ground-truth plan implied spatial knowledge already available. Still, it assumes a practical condition, earning a decent score.  
  - **Clarity:** The model-generated steps are clear and executable by the low-level executor, following proper <action> <object> format. Minor variation in terminology ("open the cabinet door" vs. "open the door") does not impair clarity for robotic understanding
