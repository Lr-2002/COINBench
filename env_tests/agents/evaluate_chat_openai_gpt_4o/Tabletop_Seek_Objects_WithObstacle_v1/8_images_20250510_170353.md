# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-WithObstacle-v1 (8 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: pick the cube
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: locate the cube inside the cabinet
Step 3: pick up the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 85/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes most essential steps, but is missing the final task goal (putting the cube on the marker). While identifying and picking the cube are important, completing the task requires placing it properly.  
  - **Correctness**: The steps in the model-generated plan are logically ordered, but deviates from the ground-truth by a minor variation in specifying "locate the cube inside the cabinet." However, this does not inherently conflict with the task flow. It's a reasonable addition, though the omission of putting the cube on the marker reduces sequential correctness.  
  - **Clarity**: Although the steps are described in a clear manner and align well with the low-level executor's syntax, "locate the cube inside the cabinet" could slightly confuse a basic executor compared to direct manipulation-focused instructions like "pick the cube."
