# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-WithObstacle-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: pick the cube
Step 3: put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 48/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan omits critical steps. Specifically, the essential step to "open the door" (step 1 in the ground truth plan) is missing. This results in incomplete coverage of the task goal.  
  - **Correctness:** The single step provided ("pick up the cube") is logically a valid action, but since the prior "open the door" step is missing, the order of actions is disrupted. This negatively affects the logical sequence and task feasibility.  
  - **Clarity:** The model-generated instruction is written in a clear and low-level format suitable for the executor (e.g., "pick up the cube"), maintaining high clarity. However, due to the lack of preceding context (e.g., opening the door), the overall plan understanding is less effective for a complete task
