# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithHolder-v1 (7 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pull the holder
Step 2: pick the cube and put it on the holder
Step 3: pick the holder and put it on the cube
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube
Step 2: put the cube on the marker
Step 3: put the holder on the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 48/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan misses essential steps. For example, the holder is not initially pulled into position before its interaction with the cube. It does not fully align with the ground-truth plan's sequence, leaving parts of the goal unaddressed.  
  - **Correctness:** Some logical issues are present in the step sequence. For instance, it instructs placing the cube on the marker (which isn't part of the stated goal) instead of putting it on the holder, as specified in the ground-truth plan. However, Step 3 seems somewhat aligned, though lacking proper sequencing from earlier steps.  
  - **Clarity:** The model-generated steps are clear enough to be executable by a low-level robot, but Step 2 introduces an unfamiliar instruction ("put the cube on the marker") that deviates from the expected ground-truth task vocabulary
