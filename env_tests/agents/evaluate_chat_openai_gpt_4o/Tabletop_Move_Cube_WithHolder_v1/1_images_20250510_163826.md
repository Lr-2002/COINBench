# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithHolder-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pull the holder
Step 2: pick the cube and put it on the holder
Step 3: pick the holder and put it on the cube
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: pick up the cube and put it to the marker
Step 4: put the holder on the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan misses essential steps from the ground-truth plan. Notably, it skips the instruction to initially "pull the holder," which is a necessary part of the setup. While it overincludes other non-essential steps (e.g., "rotate the holder till the hole upward"), the critical first step is absent.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence and logic of the model-generated steps deviate significantly from the ground-truth plan, particularly in the latter part. For example, "pick up the cube and put it to the marker" and "put the holder on the cube" are not logically tied down to the task goal as defined. Furthermore, these steps do not map correctly to the goal of using the holder to assist in cube manipulation.  
  - **Clarity:** The model-generated plan uses clear language, adhering largely to the style required for the low-level executor. However, unnecessary and ambiguous steps like "rotate the holder till the hole upward" may confuse the executor, detracting from clarity
