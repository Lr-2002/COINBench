# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithHolder-v1 (9 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pull the holder
Step 2: pick the cube and put it on the holder
Step 3: pick the holder and put it on the cube
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: move the cube to the marker
Step 4: stack all the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
The **Completeness** score is low because the model-generated plan omits essential steps from the ground-truth plan, specifically "pull the holder," and doesn't fully match the intended sequence for achieving the task. The model also introduces extra steps ("move the cube to the marker" and "stack all the cube") that are unrelated to the task goal.

## Raw GPT Response

- **Completeness**: 50/100  
- **Correctness**: 40/100  
- **Clarity**: 70/100  
- **Mean Score**: 53.3/100  
- **Justification**:  
The **Completeness** score is low because the model-generated plan omits essential steps from the ground-truth plan, specifically "pull the holder," and doesn't fully match the intended sequence for achieving the task. The model also introduces extra steps ("move the cube to the marker" and "stack all the cube") that are unrelated to the task goal.  

The **Correctness** score is also low because the sequence of steps lacks logical consistency with the task goal. For example, "rotate the holder till the hole upward" and "move the cube to the marker" are not needed and do not properly follow ground-truth logical order. Additionally, the ground-truth goal of placing both the cube and holder in a specific position (as understood from the task goal) is not fulfilled.

The **Clarity** score is moderately high since the steps are described in a clear, low-level executor-friendly language (e.g., "pick up the cube, put it in the holder"). However, clarity alone does not make up for the inaccuracies and critical omissions in the plan.

Overall, while the generated plan provides understandable instructions, it suffers from significant issues in completion and logical correctness, failing to fully accomplish the task goal.
