# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithHolder-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pull the holder
Step 2: pick the cube and put it on the holder
Step 3: pick the holder and put it on the cube
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 4: place the cube on the marker
Step 5: pick up the holder and put it on the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan has significant shortcomings in both completeness and correctness. While the steps are clear and well-formulated for a low-level executor to perform, their sequencing and inclusion of extraneous actions detract from its effectiveness. Furthermore, the plan fails to include fundamental actions from the ground-truth plan, such as “pull the holder.” This results in a task execution plan that does not align with the goal, leading to an overall mediocre performance

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 50/100  
  The model-generated plan includes some essential steps but misses critical ones from the ground-truth required to achieve the task goal directly. While it contains elements from the task, such as picking up the cube and working with the holder, it deviates significantly by introducing irrelevant actions (e.g., "rotate the holder till the hole upward" and "rotate the cube till the blue face upward") and omits clear instructions to "pull the holder." These omissions are fundamental, particularly as pulling the holder is the first required step.

- **Correctness**: 30/100  
  The order of the steps in the model-generated plan does not logically flow to achieve the task. Although the subtasks are executable by the low-level executor, their sequence and relevance are problematic. For instance, "rotate the holder till the hole upward" and "rotate the cube till the blue face upward" appear unnecessary for achieving the task. Furthermore, attempting to "place the cube on the marker" diverges from the correct progression before integrating with the holder. This misalignment significantly impacts the logical accuracy of the plan.

- **Clarity**: 70/100  
  The model-generated instructions are clear and understandable for a low-level executor. Each step is written in an explicit format that adheres to the requirements of low-level executors, using precise commands and object references. Nevertheless, clarity in itself cannot compensate for the logical errors and omissions present in the plan.

- **Mean Score**: 50/100
