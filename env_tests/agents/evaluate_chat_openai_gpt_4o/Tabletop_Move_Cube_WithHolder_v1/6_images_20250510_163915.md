# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithHolder-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pull the holder
Step 2: pick the cube and put it on the holder
Step 3: pick the holder and put it on the cube
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: move the holder with the cube to the marker
Step 4: place the holder on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
**  
  **Completeness:** The model-generated plan lacks the key step of initially "pulling the holder," which is critical as an essential first step in the ground-truth plan. Additionally, the goal of the task appears to involve moving the cube with the holder, but the model finishes with the holder being placed on the marker without adequately addressing the alignment with the explicit goal of arranging the cube and the holder per the ground truth steps.

- **Justification:**  
  **Completeness:** The model-generated plan lacks the key step of initially "pulling the holder," which is critical as an essential first step in the ground-truth plan. Additionally, the goal of the task appears to involve moving the cube with the holder, but the model finishes with the holder being placed on the marker without adequately addressing the alignment with the explicit goal of arranging the cube and the holder per the ground truth steps.  

  **Correctness:** The steps in the model-generated plan deviate significantly from the correct logical sequence and introduce unnecessary or unrelated actions. For example, "rotate the holder till the hole upward" is extraneous and does not align with the task's specific requirements. The sequencing issues, combined with the omission of "pull the holder," reduce the score for correctness.  

  **Clarity:** The steps in the model-generated plan are mostly clear and conform to the low-level executor's expected format. However, the taskâ€™s overall goal becomes ambiguous due to nonessential and unclear details, such as rotating the holder, which affects the executor's interpretability.
