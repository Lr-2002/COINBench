# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithHolder-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pull the holder
Step 2: pick the cube and put it on the holder
Step 3: pick the holder and put it on the cube
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: place the holder on the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan misses the first essential step of "pulling the holder." Omitting this step reduces the plan's overall completeness as it assumes the holder is already in position without specifically addressing this.  
  - **Correctness:** While the sequence of the given actions seems logical, there is an issue with the final step. The instruction says to "place the holder on the cube," which does not align with the ground-truth goal of "pick the holder and put it on the cube." Additionally, rotating the holder unnecessarily seems like an incorrect assumption.  
  - **Clarity:** The steps provided are described in a simple and clear format compatible with the low-level executor ("pick up the cube, put it in the holder" and "rotate the holder till the hole upward"). However, some terms could be further clarified, such as "place the holder on the cube," which may cause slight confusion due to inconsistency with the original task
