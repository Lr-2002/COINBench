# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithHolder-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pull the holder
Step 2: pick the cube and put it on the holder
Step 3: pick the holder and put it on the cube
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: stack all the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 67/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** While the model-generated plan touches on aspects of manipulating the cube and holder, it misses the initial "pull the holder" step, which is essential. Without pulling the holder, subsequent instructions might be invalid in the context of the task environment.  
  - **Correctness:** Steps are out of logical order compared to the ground-truth plan. For example, the holder is rotated before stacking all cubes, which may not fit the intended sequence of actions required to achieve the task successfully. Furthermore, "stack all the cube" does not align with the specificity required for the Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithHolder task.  
  - **Clarity:** Instructions are clear and conform to the structure suitable for a low-level executor ("pick up the cube, put it in the holder," etc.). However, certain steps (e.g., "stack all the cube") are vague and may leave ambiguity in execution
