# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithHolder-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pull the holder
Step 2: pick the cube and put it on the holder
Step 3: pick the holder and put it on the cube
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: stack all the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan misses the essential step of pulling the holder before starting the manipulation sequence, which is critical for the task as outlined by the ground-truth plan. Additionally, step 3 involves stacking cubes, which is unrelated to the explicit goal of putting the holder on the cube. Thus, the model fails to cover key steps necessary in achieving the task goal.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence in the model plan deviates significantly from the ground-truth plan. The order is illogical—starting with picking up the cube without pulling the holder (step 1), then performing an ambiguous rotation of the holder (step 2) that doesn’t align functionally, and ending with an unrelated "stack all the cube" action in step 3.  
  - **Clarity:** The low-level instructions are mostly clear and actionable for an executor. Though the actions themselves are suboptimal, they are described in a format that complies with the low-level instruction format requirements
