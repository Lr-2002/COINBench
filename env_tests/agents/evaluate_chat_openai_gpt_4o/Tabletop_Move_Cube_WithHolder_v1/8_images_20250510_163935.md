# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithHolder-v1 (8 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pull the holder
Step 2: pick the cube and put it on the holder
Step 3: pick the holder and put it on the cube
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: move the holder with the cube to the marker
Step 4: place the holder with the cube on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 75/100
- Mean Score: 75/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan performs reasonably well in terms of logical structure and clarity. However, its major flaw lies in missing a critical preparatory step ("pull the holder") from the ground-truth plan. While the steps provided are consistent in their execution logic and format, the lack of the grounding step and slightly ambiguous phrasing in the final step detract from its overall evaluation

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 70/100**  
The model-generated plan includes key actions such as placing the cube in the holder and moving the holder with the cube. However, it omits the essential initial step from the ground-truth plan: "pull the holder," a critical setup step in the task.

- **Correctness: 80/100**  
The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan is logically consistent for its interpretation of the task, and the steps follow a reasonable order. However, the omission of the "pull the holder" step disrupts the logical flow relative to the full ground-truth specification.

- **Clarity: 75/100**  
The model-generated steps are mostly clear, adhering to the low-level executorâ€™s language. However, "place the holder with the cube on the marker" is slightly ambiguous, as it doesn't explicitly describe ensuring accuracy in the placement or configuration.

- **Mean Score: 75/100**  

- **Justification:**  
The model-generated plan performs reasonably well in terms of logical structure and clarity. However, its major flaw lies in missing a critical preparatory step ("pull the holder") from the ground-truth plan. While the steps provided are consistent in their execution logic and format, the lack of the grounding step and slightly ambiguous phrasing in the final step detract from its overall evaluation.
