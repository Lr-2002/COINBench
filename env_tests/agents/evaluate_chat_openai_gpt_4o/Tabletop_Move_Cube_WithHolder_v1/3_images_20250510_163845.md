# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithHolder-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pull the holder
Step 2: pick the cube and put it on the holder
Step 3: pick the holder and put it on the cube
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: stack all the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 75/100
- Mean Score: 62/100

## Justification
**  
  - For **Completeness**, the model-generated plan misses the critical first step from the ground-truth plan, which is "pull the holder." This makes the plan incomplete as the holder's positioning is essential to the success of subsequent actions.  
  - For **Correctness**, the model-generated plan is flawed in step sequencing. It attempts to "stack all the cube" before explicitly addressing the placement of the holder, which logically disrupts the task's proper sequence. Tasks involving dependencies on earlier steps being implicitly fulfilled but are not explicitly stated are problematic.  
  - For **Clarity**, while the instructions provided match the format expected by the low-level executor and are syntactically clear, step 2 ("stack all the cube") is ambiguous, as it does not specify the desired configuration relative to the holder. The use of plural ("all the cube") might also introduce confusion
