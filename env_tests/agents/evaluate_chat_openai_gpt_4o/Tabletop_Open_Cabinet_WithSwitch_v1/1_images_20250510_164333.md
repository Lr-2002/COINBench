## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 100/100
- Correctness: 100/100
- Clarity: 100/100
- Mean Score: 100/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan includes all essential steps specified in the ground-truth plan, thus scoring full marks for completeness. The sequence of steps is logically and sequentially correct ("turn on the trigger" followed by "open the door" matches the ground-truth order of "open the trigger" followed by "open the cabinet door"). For clarity, the language used in the model-generated plan adheres to the low-level executor's format and is clear and unambiguous. There is no deviation in semantics or execution, resulting in perfect scores across all criteria
