Step 2: open the cabinet door
```

## Generated Plan

Step 1: turn on the trigger
Step 2: open the door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 100/100
- Correctness: 100/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 98/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan includes both essential steps required for fulfilling the task goal as outlined in the ground-truth plan: activating the "trigger" and opening the "cabinet door."  
  - **Correctness:** The order of actions is logical and mirrors the ground-truth plan, progressing from activating the trigger to opening the door. Both steps are sequentially and logically correct.  
  - **Clarity:** The model-generated plan uses clear instructions that align well with the required low-level executor format. However, while "turn on the trigger" is functionally equivalent to "open the trigger" and "open the door" matches "open the cabinet door," they introduce slight labeling inconsistencies. Thus, a small penalty (5 points) is applied for potential ambiguity regarding whether the correct doors or components are handled
