Step 2: open the cabinet door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: turn on the trigger
Step 2: open the door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 100/100
- Correctness: 100/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 97/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes all essential steps from the ground-truth plan (turning on the trigger and opening the door/cabinet door). It fulfills the task goal entirely, and no necessary actions are omitted.  
  - **Correctness**: The sequence of steps is logically correct and maintains the intended ordering or progression of the task (trigger must be turned on before the cabinet is opened).  
  - **Clarity**: While "turn on the trigger" and "open the door" are clear and understandable actions for the low-level executor, "open the door" is slightly ambiguous when compared to "open the cabinet door" in the ground-truth plan. The slight generic phrasing ("the door") might cause minor confusion in environments with multiple doors
