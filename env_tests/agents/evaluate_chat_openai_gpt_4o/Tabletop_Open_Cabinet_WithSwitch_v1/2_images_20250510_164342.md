# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Open-Cabinet-WithSwitch-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the trigger
Step 2: open the cabinet door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: turn on the trigger
Step 2: open the door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 100/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 93/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** Both the ground-truth plan and the model-generated plan include all essential steps necessary for completing the task. Opening the trigger (or "turning on the trigger") and opening the cabinet door meet the requirements of the task. Thus, the model-generated plan is complete.  
  - **Correctness:** The logical order of steps in the model plan is correct. However, the terminology used ("open the door") instead of the more specific "open the cabinet door" is ambiguous as there could exist other doors in the environment. Hence, the score is slightly reduced to account for potential confusion about the sequence or task semantics.  
  - **Clarity:** While "turn on the trigger" is clear and suited for a low-level executor, "open the door" is slightly less specific, introducing a potential for misunderstanding. Specifying "cabinet door" would increase clarity further. Nevertheless, the generated plan is sufficiently clear overall
