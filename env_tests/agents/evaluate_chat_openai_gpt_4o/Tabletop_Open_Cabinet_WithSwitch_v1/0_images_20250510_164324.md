## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 100/100
- Correctness: 100/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 97/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan includes all essential steps to achieve the task goal ("turn on the trigger" and "open the door"), matching the human-annotated ground-truth plan.  
  - **Correctness:** The steps are logically and sequentially correct. Step 1 ("turn on the trigger") appropriately precedes Step 2 ("open the door"), matching the order of the ground-truth plan.  
  - **Clarity:** While understandable, "open the door" is slightly less precise than "open the cabinet door" in describing the target object. The low-level executor might interpret "door" ambiguously without additional context, which slightly reduces clarity
