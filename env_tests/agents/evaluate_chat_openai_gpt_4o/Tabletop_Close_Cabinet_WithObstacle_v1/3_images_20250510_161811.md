# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Close-Cabinet-WithObstacle-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: move out the obstacle
Step 3: clo/*  */se the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: No action needed; the cabinet door is already open.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 30/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan lacks essential steps. Despite stating no action is needed for the cabinet door (Step 1), it ignores crucial subsequent steps from the task goal, such as "move out the obstacle" and "close the door." Therefore, it demonstrates significant omissions.  
  - **Correctness**: While it correctly identified that the cabinet door is open, the plan does not organize the remaining steps logically. The correct sequence should ensure obstacle removal is prioritized before closing the door.  
  - **Clarity**: The single action described shows clarity but does not comply with the expected low-level format ("<action> the <object>"). Ambiguity arises if interpreted by a low-level executor, as only future steps are described by implication
