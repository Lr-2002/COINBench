## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 51/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes only the first step of the task, "open the cabinet door," and entirely omits the critical steps of "moving out the obstacle" and "closing the door." Since these are essential to achieving the task goal, the plan is highly incomplete.  
  - **Correctness**: The single step provided, "open the cabinet door," is logically correct but represents only an initial step in the sequence. While correct on its own, the sequential flow depends on the missing steps, reducing the overall correctness score.  
  - **Clarity**: The step "open the cabinet door" is described clearly and in a format understandable to the low-level executor. While the single instruction is concise, clarity is limited by the absence of subsequent steps, which would provide necessary context for the task goal
