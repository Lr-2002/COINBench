# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Close-Cabinet-WithObstacle-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: move out the obstacle
Step 3: clo/*  */se the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 100/100
- Mean Score: 61/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan is clear in its single step, but it lacks completeness, as it fails to list the essential actions that follow in the sequence, specifically moving the obstacle and closing the door. It also scores moderately on correctness because the single step provided is correct in isolation, though the overall sequence is incomplete

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 33/100  
  The model-generated plan only includes the first step ("open the cabinet door") and does not account for moving the obstacle or closing the cabinet door, which are essential steps to achieve the task goal. It is largely incomplete.

- **Correctness**: 50/100  
  While the single step provided (opening the cabinet door) is logically correct and aligned with the sequence required in the ground-truth plan, the lack of subsequent steps means the plan is not sequentially or logically complete.

- **Clarity**: 100/100  
  The provided step is described clearly and in an understandable manner for a low-level executor, as it aligns perfectly with the expected instruction format ("open the cabinet door").

- **Mean Score**: 61/100  

- **Justification**:  
  The model-generated plan is clear in its single step, but it lacks completeness, as it fails to list the essential actions that follow in the sequence, specifically moving the obstacle and closing the door. It also scores moderately on correctness because the single step provided is correct in isolation, though the overall sequence is incomplete.
