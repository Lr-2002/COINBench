## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan does not include all essential steps required to complete the task (missing "move out the obstacle" and "close the door"). Partial completion hampers the ability of the robot to successfully achieve the goal.  
  - **Correctness**: Though the steps follow logical order, the missing steps create an incomplete sequence, undermining the logical progression toward achieving the entire task.  
  - **Clarity**: The single step provided ("open the cabinet door") is described clearly and in a format suitable for the low-level executor, which makes this criterion strong despite lacking other steps
