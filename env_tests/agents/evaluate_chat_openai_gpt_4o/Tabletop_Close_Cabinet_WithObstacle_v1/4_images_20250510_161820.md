Step 1: open the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 63/100

## Justification
**  
  **Completeness:** The model-generated plan includes only the first step (`open the cabinet door`) and entirely omits essential subsequent steps, such as `move out the obstacle` and `close the door`. This results in significant incompleteness, as only a part of the task is addressed.  
  **Correctness:** The provided step is correct in isolation, but since it does not follow up with the necessary subsequent steps, the overall logical flow and sequential correctness are disrupted. This results in a partial score.  
  **Clarity:** The single step is described clearly and adheres to the task representation required for the low-level executor. However, clarity doesn't fully make up for the missing key steps
