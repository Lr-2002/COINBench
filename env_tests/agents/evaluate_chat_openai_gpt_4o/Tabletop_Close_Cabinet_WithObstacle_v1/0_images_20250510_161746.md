Step 1: open the door
Step 2: move out the obstacle
Step 3: clo/*  */se the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 48/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan only includes the step to "open the cabinet door," which represents the first step in the ground-truth plan. Essential steps, such as moving the obstacle and closing the door, are completely missing, making the plan significantly incomplete.  
   - **Correctness**: The step provided ("open the cabinet door") is correct as a first step and aligns logically with executing the task. However, since subsequent steps are absent, the plan's overall correctness is only partial.  
   - **Clarity**: The step is described clearly and is actionable by the low-level executor (“open the cabinet door”). However, since it is incomplete, the lack of additional steps makes the task less clear as a whole
