Step 2: move out the obstacle
Step 3: clo/*  */se the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 54/100

## Justification
**  
   * **Completeness:** The model-generated plan includes a valid starting step ("open the cabinet door") but omits two essential actions: "moving out the obstacle" and "closing the door." Only one out of three steps is included, significantly reducing the completeness score.  
   * **Correctness:** While the first step ("open the cabinet door") is logically correct and sequentially aligned with the ground-truth plan, the absence of subsequent critical actions results in a 50% correctness score since the plan can't complete the task as intended.  
   * **Clarity:** The single step provided is written in a clear and understandable format, suitable for execution by the low-level robot, earning a high clarity score. However, clarity is only evaluated for the single provided step
