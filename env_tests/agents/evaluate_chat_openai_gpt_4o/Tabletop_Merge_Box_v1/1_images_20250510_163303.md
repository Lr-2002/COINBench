# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Merge-Box-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the ball and put it on the hole of the box
Step 2: pick the cube which have plat on the top and put it on the ball
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: stack all the cube
Step 2: put the ball into the container
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 43/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan fails to include essential steps specific to the task goal. While the ground-truth plan clearly outlines placing the ball on the hole of the box and then stacking a particular cube on top, the model plan misses these task-specific details and instead provides generic stacking and ball-handling steps.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence of steps in the model plan (stacking cubes and putting the ball into the container) does not align logically with the task goal outlined in the ground-truth plan. Additionally, these steps do not appear in the correct order needed to meet the goal. Moreover, they are unrelated to the core actions required for Tabletop-Merge-Box-v1.  
  - **Clarity:** While the individual actions are described in a low-level understandable language ("stack all the cube" and "put the ball into the container"), the lack of relevance to the task goal reduces the overall clarity of how these steps achieve the task
