# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Merge-Box-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the ball and put it on the hole of the box
Step 2: pick the cube which have plat on the top and put it on the ball
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: search for the ball on the tabletop or in nearby storage areas.
Step 2: search for the boxes on the tabletop or in nearby storage areas.
Step 3: pick up the ball.
Step 4: stack all the cube (boxes).
Step 5: put the ball into the container (if the container is part of the merging process).
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
- The model-generated plan diverges significantly from the Ground-Truth Plan, both in terms of essential steps (Completeness) and their logical sequence (Correctness). While some instructions are clear (e.g., "pick up the ball"), others leave room for interpretation, reducing Clarity. The overall execution quality would likely fail to meet the task goal as intended

### Evaluation of Model-Generated Plan:

#### Completeness: 50/100  
- The model-generated plan lacks the essential step of placing the ball *on the hole of the box* and does not include the step of placing the cube with the plat on top onto the ball. These are critical actions in the Ground-Truth Plan necessary to achieve the task goal. While it identifies searching for key components and has some stacking actions, the merging process outlined in the task goal is not explicitly completed.

#### Correctness: 40/100  
- The sequence of steps is inaccurate compared to the Ground-Truth Plan. "Stack all the cube" and "put the ball into the container" are misplaced actions, as they deviate from the specific instructions of merging the ball and cube on the box. Furthermore, searching steps (Step 1 and Step 2) are redundant considering the original Ground-Truth Plan does not involve searching, which indicates inefficiency in the logical ordering of steps.

#### Clarity: 70/100  
- Most individual steps are described clearly enough for the low-level executor ("pick up the ball", "stack all the cube"). However, some descriptions, such as "search for the ball on the tabletop or in nearby storage areas" and "put the ball into the container (if the container is part of the merging process)," introduce ambiguity. These instructions are not specific enough to ensure precise execution in the given benchmark environment.

#### Mean Score: **53.33/100**

#### Justification:
- The model-generated plan diverges significantly from the Ground-Truth Plan, both in terms of essential steps (Completeness) and their logical sequence (Correctness). While some instructions are clear (e.g., "pick up the ball"), others leave room for interpretation, reducing Clarity. The overall execution quality would likely fail to meet the task goal as intended.
