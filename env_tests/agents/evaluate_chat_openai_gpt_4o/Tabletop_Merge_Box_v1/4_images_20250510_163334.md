# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Merge-Box-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the ball and put it on the hole of the box
Step 2: pick the cube which have plat on the top and put it on the ball
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: search for the ball in the environment
Step 2: stack all the cubes
Step 3: put the ball into the container or on top of the stacked cubes
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 30/100
- Correctness: 20/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 33/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan misses essential steps from the ground-truth plan. Specifically, the model does not explicitly direct the robot to "pick the ball and put it on the hole of the box" and "pick the cube with plat on the top and put it on the ball." Additionally, the model-generated steps include unclear and unnecessary instructions that diverge from the task.  
  - **Correctness:** The model-generated plan demonstrates incorrect sequencing and logical gaps. For instance, "stack all the cubes" is executed prematurely, and the condition about where to place the ball ("into the container or on top of stacked cubes") does not align with the ground-truth goal, which requires placing the ball in a specific box hole.  
  - **Clarity:** While some instructions are clear ("search for the ball in the environment"), the use of ambiguous phrasing like "put the ball into the container or on top of the stacked cubes" is not precise enough for a low-level executor. The plan should have used exact formulations like "put the ball on the hole of the box." The lack of structure and deterministic phrasing reduces clarity
