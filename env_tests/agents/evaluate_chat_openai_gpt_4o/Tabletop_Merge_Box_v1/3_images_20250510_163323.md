# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Merge-Box-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the ball and put it on the hole of the box
Step 2: pick the cube which have plat on the top and put it on the ball
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: stack all the cube
Step 2: put the ball into the container
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan misses the crucial detail of placing the cube with the plate on top onto the ball, as specified in the ground-truth. Instead, it suggests a generic "stack all the cube" step, which is not task-specific and doesn't satisfy the exact goal.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence in the model-generated plan is inconsistent with the ground-truth plan's intent. Specifically, stacking cubes first and then putting the ball into a container does not logically follow the ground-truth trajectory, nor does it fulfill the task requirements. Additionally, "put the ball into the container" doesn't align with placing the ball on the box hole.  
  - **Clarity:** The instructions are clearly phrased with respect to the allowed low-level executor instruction format (e.g., "stack all the cube" and "put the ball into the container"), making the plan easy to understand. However, clarity doesn't compensate for the lack of correctness or alignment with the specified task goal
