# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Merge-Box-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the ball and put it on the hole of the box
Step 2: pick the cube which have plat on the top and put it on the ball
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Locate the cubes and stack all the cubes.
Step 2: Locate the ball and the container.
Step 3: Put the ball into the container.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan diverges significantly from the goal-specific instructions outlined in the ground-truth plan. While the steps are clear and executable, they do not fully capture the essential actions or proper sequence required to accomplish the task

### Evaluation of Model-Generated Plan:

#### Completeness: 50/100  
The model-generated plan partially addresses the task goal but misses critical details specified in the ground-truth plan. Specifically, the model plan fails to mention placing the correct cube (with a flat top) on top of the ball, a crucial step in completing the task. Furthermore, stating "stack all the cubes" deviates from the specific action sequence of the ground-truth task.  

#### Correctness: 40/100  
The steps in the model-generated plan are logically possible but diverge significantly from the correct sequence in the ground-truth plan. While stacking cubes might be a valid action, the model's plan doesn't handle the ordered manipulation required to achieve the goal. The process of placing the ball in the container does not align with the goal provided in the ground-truth plan.  

#### Clarity: 60/100  
The steps in the model-generated plan are described in a clear and understandable way for a low-level executor, adhering to the expected instruction format. However, using "stack all the cubes" is ambiguous and broad, not properly tailored to the task at hand. This reduces clarity in terms of specific task fulfillment.  

#### Mean Score: 50/100  

#### Justification:  
The model-generated plan diverges significantly from the goal-specific instructions outlined in the ground-truth plan. While the steps are clear and executable, they do not fully capture the essential actions or proper sequence required to accomplish the task.
