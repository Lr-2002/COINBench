# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Merge-Box-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the ball and put it on the hole of the box
Step 2: pick the cube which have plat on the top and put it on the ball
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: search for the ball in the environment
Step 2: search for the container in the environment
Step 3: stack all the cubes
Step 4: put the ball into the container
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 47/100

## Justification
- *Completeness*: The model-generated plan omits the crucial second step from the ground-truth plan, where the cube with a flat top is picked and placed on top of the ball. While the model-generated plan includes some steps (like handling the ball), it fails to fully tackle the task goal of merging boxes, specifically in relation to accurate cube placement.  
  - *Correctness*: The sequence of steps in the model plan does not logically achieve the task. It starts with unnecessary search actions, introduces an unrelated step to "stack all the cubes," and places the ball "into the container" instead of putting it on the box hole. Thus, it deviates from the logical flow required to complete the task.  
  - *Clarity*: While individual steps like "search for the ball in the environment" or "put the ball into the container" are well-formulated and clear for the low-level executor, the plan as a whole lacks clarity in capturing the task goal. Specificity like "cube with a flat top" and explicit actions to place objects properly are missing compared to the ground-truth plan
