# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Merge-Box-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the ball and put it on the hole of the box
Step 2: pick the cube which have plat on the top and put it on the ball
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: stack all the cube
Step 2: put the ball into the container
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 47/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan is missing crucial details and steps compared to the ground-truth plan. Specifically, it does not account for the conditional handling of the ball and cube based on their position and the sequence dictated by the task goal. For example, in the ground-truth plan, the ball is specifically placed *on the hole of the box*, and the cube placement is dependent on the ball's position. The model's plan doesn't align with this more nuanced and complete requirement, instead using generic instructions like "stack all the cubes".   
  - **Correctness**: The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan is logically incoherent for the given task. "Stack all the cubes" should follow contextually at *some steps of sequences_completion
