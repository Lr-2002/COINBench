# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cylinder-WithObstacle-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: push left every cylinder
Step 2: pick the center cylinder
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Move the robotic arm to the center cylinder's location.
Step 2: Adjust the gripper to align with the center cylinder.
Step 3: Close the gripper to grasp the center cylinder.
Step 4: Lift the center cylinder off the tabletop.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 67/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits the essential step of "pushing left every cylinder" before picking the center cylinder, which is critical for clearing obstacles. This omission significantly affects the task's success, leading to a low completeness score. It only focuses on picking the center cylinder.
  
  - **Correctness**: The sequential order and logic of the steps described in the model-generated plan are generally correct for picking an unobstructed cylinder. However, since the plan disregards the initial obstacle-clearing step from the ground-truth plan, it assumes a condition that is not guaranteed (i.e., the center cylinder being accessible). Thus, correctness is somewhat flawed but not entirely incorrect.
  
  - **Clarity**: The step descriptions in the model-generated plan are clear and aligned with low-level executor instructions. The steps are simple and follow the "<action> the <object>" structure, making them easily interpretable by an executor. Hence, clarity is given a high score. However, it could have been slightly more explicit in detailing movements or conditions.

  The average score reflects that while the model's plan is clear and logically sound, it suffers substantially from incompleteness due to missing a critical step.
