# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cylinder-WithObstacle-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: push left every cylinder
Step 2: pick the center cylinder
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: move the gripper above the center cylinder
Step 2: adjust the gripper to align with the cylinder
Step 3: lower the gripper to grasp the cylinder
Step 4: close the gripper to securely hold the cylinder
Step 5: lift the cylinder off the table
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 68/100

## Justification
- The model-generated plan is partially complete for only the cylinder-picking aspect of the task, ignoring the obstacle removal as specified in the ground-truth plan, thus scoring low on completeness.
- The steps provided are logically correct and sequential for grasping the cylinder, so it scores higher for correctness but loses points for not addressing the broader task context.
- The use of clear and actionable language makes the plan relatively strong in clarity, although the absence of obstacle-related instructions indicates some ambiguity for task execution

## Raw GPT Response
```
### Evaluation of Model-Generated Plan:

#### Completeness: 40/100
The model-generated plan fails to address the obstacle (moving or pushing other cylinders), which is necessary before picking the center cylinder as outlined in the ground-truth plan. While it efficiently details the sequence of grasping the cylinder, essential preparatory steps are missing.

#### Correctness: 80/100
The steps provided in the model-generated plan are logically and sequentially correct for picking up the cylinder, but they are incomplete with regard to the overall task context. Also, the neglect of obstacle handling makes the logical sequence incomplete if judged in the full task scope.

#### Clarity: 85/100
The steps are clear and use low-level instructions that are understandable for the executor. However, the omission of obstacle-related instructions could confuse the executor if they encounter obstructions during execution.

#### Mean Score: 68.3/100

#### Justification:
- The model-generated plan is partially complete for only the cylinder-picking aspect of the task, ignoring the obstacle removal as specified in the ground-truth plan, thus scoring low on completeness.
- The steps provided are logically correct and sequential for grasping the cylinder, so it scores higher for correctness but loses points for not addressing the broader task context.
- The use of clear and actionable language makes the plan relatively strong in clarity, although the absence of obstacle-related instructions indicates some ambiguity for task execution.
