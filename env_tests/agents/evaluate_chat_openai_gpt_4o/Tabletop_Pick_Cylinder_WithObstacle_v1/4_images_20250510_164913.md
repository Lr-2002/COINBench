# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cylinder-WithObstacle-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: push left every cylinder
Step 2: pick the center cylinder
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: locate the center cylinder visually
Step 2: move the gripper to the center cylinder
Step 3: grasp the center cylinder with the gripper
Step 4: lift the center cylinder
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 73/100

## Justification
**
  The model-generated plan assumes prior actions to clear obstacles (likely conditioned on partial subtasks already completed), but it fails to explicitly include the crucial first step from the ground truth plan. Although its proposed actions to pick the cylinder are correct and clear, the omission of obstacle handling greatly impacts completeness. Slight deductions in correctness were made due to this omission, but clarity remains high as the steps are understandable and executable

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 50/100**
  The model-generated plan does not include the essential initial step of "pushing left every cylinder," which is necessary to clear obstacles as outlined by the ground-truth plan. It focuses solely on picking the center cylinder and neglects a prerequisite subtask.

- **Correctness: 80/100**
  The steps provided in the model-generated plan are logically and sequentially correct for picking up the center cylinder, assuming obstacles were already cleared. However, since the plan omits the critical obstacle-clearance step, the logical sequencing is incomplete for the overall goal. 

- **Clarity: 90/100**
  The instructions in the model-generated plan are detailed, clear, and follow the syntax required for the low-level executor (e.g., "<action> the <object>"). The steps can be easily interpreted by the robot.

- **Mean Score: 73.33/100**
