# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cylinder-WithObstacle-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: push left every cylinder
Step 2: pick the center cylinder
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: locate the cylinder visually
Step 2: move the robotic arm to the cylinder's position
Step 3: grasp the cylinder with the gripper
Step 4: lift the cylinder
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 67/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan misses an essential preliminary step: moving other obstructing cylinders (pushing every cylinder left) before grasping the center cylinder. This omission makes the goal potentially unachievable since the obstacles remain unaddressed.  
  - **Correctness**: The steps provided are clear, logical, and sequentially correct for grasping a cylinder as an isolated subtask. However, the omission of handling obstacles makes the plan incomplete for the task as a whole.  
  - **Clarity**: The steps are described in a straightforward manner using low-level instructions that a robotic executor can interpret. The missing obstacle handling steps do not affect the clarity of the actions described
