# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cylinder-WithObstacle-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: push left every cylinder
Step 2: pick the center cylinder
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Approach the center cylinder.
Step 2: Grasp the center cylinder with the gripper.
Step 3: Lift the center cylinder.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 67/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan provides a simplified approach but omits a critical precondition for success (moving the other cylinders). Its logical flow is valid only under certain assumptions (i.e., that obstacles have already been cleared) and thus has lower correctness and completeness. Clarity is relatively stronger due to clear instruction language but lacks fine-grained attention to object conditions

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 50/100**  
  The model-generated plan misses an essential step from the ground-truth plan: pushing the obstacles (other cylinders) to the left before picking the center cylinder. Without clearing the obstacles, the task cannot be successfully executed in many scenarios.

- **Correctness: 70/100**  
  While the sequence of steps in the generated plan is logical if the obstacles are already cleared, it fails to account for the need to move obstacles first as indicated by the ground-truth plan. This limits correctness in a realistic setting.

- **Clarity: 80/100**  
  The steps in the generated plan are described clearly and follow a low-level executor-friendly format ("Approach the center cylinder," "Grasp the center cylinder with the gripper," etc.). However, it could be slightly more precise by specifying spatial context (e.g., "Approach the unobstructed center cylinder").

- **Mean Score: 67/100**

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan provides a simplified approach but omits a critical precondition for success (moving the other cylinders). Its logical flow is valid only under certain assumptions (i.e., that obstacles have already been cleared) and thus has lower correctness and completeness.
