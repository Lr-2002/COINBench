# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cylinder-WithObstacle-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: push left every cylinder
Step 2: pick the center cylinder
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Identify the center cylinder among the group of cylinders.
Step 2: Position the gripper above the center cylinder.
Step 3: Lower the gripper to grasp the center cylinder.
Step 4: Close the gripper to securely hold the cylinder.
Step 5: Lift the cylinder off the table.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 20/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan excludes a critical step specified in the ground-truth plan: "push left every cylinder." Handling the obstacles (other cylinders) is essential to achieving the task goal safely. Without this, the plan is incomplete.  
  - **Correctness:** Although the individual steps in the model-generated plan are ordered logically and make sense for picking a cylinder, they assume no obstructions, which contradicts the conditions described in the task. Ignoring the obstacle-handling step makes the plan partially incorrect.  
  - **Clarity:** The model-generated steps are explicit and low-level, using clear and understandable language, suitable for the low-level executor. This earns it a high clarity score
