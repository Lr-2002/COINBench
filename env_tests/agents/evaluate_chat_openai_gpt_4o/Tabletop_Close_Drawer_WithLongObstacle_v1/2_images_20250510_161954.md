# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Close-Drawer-WithLongObstacle-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the drawer
Step 2: pick the board and put it on the desk
Step 3: close the drawer
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: close the drawer
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan is incomplete, as it omits essential intermediate steps such as opening the drawer and removing the long obstacle (board) before closing it. This results in a significant reduction in the completeness score. The correctness score is also low because the proposed sequence ("close the drawer") assumes the task can be completed without addressing the obstacle, which contradicts the logical flow of the task. However, the clarity of the single instruction provided is high, as it is appropriately formatted for the low-level executor and is easy to understand. Overall, the omission of crucial actions and logical errors heavily penalizes the plan
