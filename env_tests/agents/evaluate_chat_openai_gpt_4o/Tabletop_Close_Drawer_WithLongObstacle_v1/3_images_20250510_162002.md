Step 1: close the drawer
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 100/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits essential steps from the Ground-Truth Plan. Specifically, it neglects the step to open the drawer and remove the long obstacle (the board) before closing the drawer. This oversight makes the plan incomplete.  
   - **Correctness**: The step "close the drawer" is correct in isolation. However, the sequence is incorrect because it assumes the drawer can be closed without addressing the obstacle first, contrary to the task requirement.  
   - **Clarity**: The model-generated plan uses clear, low-level language compatible with the executor's requirement ("close the drawer"). Despite being incomplete, the instructions are clear and well-structured
