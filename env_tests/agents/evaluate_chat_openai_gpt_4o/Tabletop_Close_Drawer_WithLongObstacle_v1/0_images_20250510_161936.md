## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 30/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
- *Completeness*: The model-generated plan fails to include the essential steps of removing the long obstacle (the board) from the drawer before attempting to close it. Without this step, the task cannot realistically be completed.  
  - *Correctness*: While the single step "close the drawer" is technically correct if the drawer was ready to be closed, the logical sequence is incorrect since it skips prior required steps like opening the drawer and removing the obstacle (the board).  
  - *Clarity*: The step "close the drawer" is clear and adheres to the low-level executor's expected format. However, this clarity is undermined by its lack of context and omission of necessary preceding actions
