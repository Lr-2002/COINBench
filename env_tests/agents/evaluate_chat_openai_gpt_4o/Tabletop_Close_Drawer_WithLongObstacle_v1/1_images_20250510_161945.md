## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 54/100

## Justification
- *Completeness*: The model-generated plan is missing essential steps. Specifically, it skips opening the drawer and removing the obstacle (the board) before closing the drawer. This omission significantly impacts task completeness.  
  - *Correctness*: While "close the drawer" is logically correct as a step, it's out of order given the context of the task. Attempting to close the drawer without first removing the obstacle (the board) would result in task failure. Therefore, the sequential order is flawed.  
  - *Clarity*: The instruction "close the drawer" is clearly and concisely described in the required low-level format, hence the high score for clarity
