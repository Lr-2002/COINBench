## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 33/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 54/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits essential steps from the ground-truth plan. Specifically, it does not account for handling the long obstacle (board) on the desk that is blocking the drawer's closure. Without addressing this, the task goal cannot be effectively accomplished.  
  - **Correctness**: While "close the drawer" is a logically correct step, it is out of order given the context of the task. The board must first be removed before the drawer can be successfully closed.  
  - **Clarity**: The step "close the drawer" is clear and adheres to the format of instructions understandable by the low-level executor. However, clarity alone does not compensate for missing or misordered steps
