# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Close-Drawer-WithLongObstacle-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the drawer
Step 2: pick the board and put it on the desk
Step 3: close the drawer
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: close the drawer
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness (40/100):** The model-generated plan skips essential steps from the ground-truth plan, specifically "open the drawer" and "pick the board and put it on the desk," both of which are necessary actions before closing the drawer. The generated plan only includes the final action without acknowledging prerequisites.  
  - **Correctness (30/100):** The sequence of actions in the generated plan is logically flawed because it tries to close the drawer directly, which is likely blocked by the long obstacle (board). Without removing the board, the drawer cannot be closed, making the generated plan impractical for achieving the task goal.   
  - **Clarity (90/100):** The single step "close the drawer" is clearly described, aligns well with the low-level executor's instruction format, and is easy to follow. However, this clarity cannot compensate for the incomplete and incorrect aspect of the plan
