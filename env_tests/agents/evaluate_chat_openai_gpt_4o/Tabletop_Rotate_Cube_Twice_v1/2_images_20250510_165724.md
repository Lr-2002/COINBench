# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Rotate-Cube-Twice-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the cube for 90
Step 2: rotate the cube for 90
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube
Step 2: rotate the cube till the green face upward
Step 3: place the cube back on the table
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 57/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan fails in both **Completeness** and **Correctness**, as it does not include the necessary rotations to meet the task goal and introduces extraneous steps (e.g., picking and placing the cube). While the instructions are clear for the low-level executor, their lack of alignment with the goal limits their effectiveness

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 50/100**  
  The model-generated plan does not achieve the full task goal. While it involves manipulating the cube, it does not include the two rotations of 90 degrees specified in the task goal and ground-truth plan. Instead, it rotates the cube only until the green face is upward and then stops prematurely.

- **Correctness: 40/100**  
  The sequence of steps is logical, but the actions do not align with the task goal or the ground-truth plan. Rotating the cube till the green face is upward and placing it back on the table neither completes nor progresses toward the required two 90-degree rotations. Additionally, there is no requirement in the task to pick the cube up or place it back.

- **Clarity: 80/100**  
  The steps are described clearly in an understandable format for the low-level executor. Each action is straightforward and adheres to the format required (e.g., "pick up the cube," "rotate the cube till the green face upward"). However, the instructions could better align with the task goal.

- **Mean Score: 57/100**

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan fails in both **Completeness** and **Correctness**, as it does not include the necessary rotations to meet the task goal and introduces extraneous steps (e.g., picking and placing the cube). While the instructions are clear for the low-level executor, their lack of alignment with the goal limits their effectiveness.
