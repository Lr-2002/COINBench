# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Rotate-Cube-Twice-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the cube for 90
Step 2: rotate the cube for 90
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the cube till the green face upward
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan is missing one essential step. The task goal indicates that the cube needs to be rotated twice, which means two separate 90-degree rotations. The plan only describes one rotation, and further details about continuing the task are omitted.  
  - **Correctness:** The model-generated plan attempts to orient the cube, but "rotate the cube till the green face upward" does not ensure two 90-degree rotations sequentially. Depending on the current state of the cube, this instruction might lead to logical inconsistencies or fail to fulfill the task goal entirely.  
  - **Clarity:** While the step is phrased in a simple and executable way for the low-level executor, the instruction "rotate the cube till the green face upward" is reliant on contextual information (initial color alignment) and does not explicitly state the desired angle of rotation. It is less precise than calling out the rotations as "rotate the cube for 90."
