# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Rotate-Cube-Twice-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the cube for 90
Step 2: rotate the cube for 90
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube
Step 2: rotate the cube till the green face upward
Step 3: place the cube back on the table
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 30/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan is partially complete but misses an essential step (second rotation). The steps provided are logically ordered but fail to align fully with the task goal. Clarity is adequate, but the instructions deviate slightly from the precise formulation required to execute the specific manipulation task successfully

## Raw GPT Response
```
### Evaluation:

#### Completeness: 30/100  
The model-generated plan includes picking up the cube, rotating it once (to a specific face), and placing it back down. However, the goal requires **two rotations** of the cube (90 degrees twice), and the model only specifies rotating it once. Hence, it misses the second essential rotation step required to complete the task.

#### Correctness: 50/100  
The model-generated sequence logically progresses with steps that could happen in order (pick up → rotate → place back). However, the cube must be rotated **twice** to satisfy the task goal, and the model incorrectly assumes a single rotation (to a specific face) fulfills the task. The omission of the second rotation disrupts the logical execution and order to achieve the intended goal.

#### Clarity: 70/100  
The instructions in the model-generated plan are clear and understandable for a low-level executor. Actions like "pick up the cube," "rotate the cube till the green face upward," and "place the cube back on the table" are consistent with the required format. However, the inclusion of "till the green face upward" introduces unnecessary ambiguity, as the task specifies rotating the cube 90 degrees twice, not orienting it to a colored face.

#### Mean Score: 50/100  

#### Justification:  
The model-generated plan is partially complete but misses an essential step (second rotation). The steps provided are logically ordered but fail to align fully with the task goal. Clarity is adequate, but the instructions deviate slightly from the precise formulation required to execute the specific manipulation task successfully.
