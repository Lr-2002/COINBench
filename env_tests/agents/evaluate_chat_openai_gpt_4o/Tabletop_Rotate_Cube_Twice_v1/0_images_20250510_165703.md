# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Rotate-Cube-Twice-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the cube for 90
Step 2: rotate the cube for 90
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Locate the cube on the tabletop.
Step 2: Assess the current orientation of the cube to identify the position of the green face.
Step 3: Rotate the cube till the green face is upward.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan does not include sufficient actions to achieve the task goal of rotating the cube twice by 90 degrees. Instead, it appears to overcomplicate the task by introducing unnecessary steps like identifying the green face, which is absent from the goal in the ground-truth plan. Only part of the rotation task is addressed, and it does not include the second rotation.
  - **Correctness**: The sequence begins with locating the cube, which is logical, but the inclusion of identifying the green face is irrelevant and diverges from the intended goal. Furthermore, the plan does not address rotating the cube twice as specified in the goal, rendering the sequence order misaligned with the task.
  - **Clarity**: While the steps provided are somewhat clear, they deviate from the low-level executor's acceptable instruction format. For instance, "Assess the current orientation" and "Rotate the cube till the green face is upward" are not simple or executable commands. Phrasing like "rotate the cube till the green face is upward" would benefit from being rephrased to match the style of commands the executor can accept (e.g., "rotate the cube till the green face is upward")
