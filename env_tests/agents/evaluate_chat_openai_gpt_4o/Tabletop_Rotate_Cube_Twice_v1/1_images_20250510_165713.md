# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Rotate-Cube-Twice-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the cube for 90
Step 2: rotate the cube for 90
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: rotate the cube till the green face upward
Step 4: place the cube back on the table
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 57/100

## Justification
**  
  1. **Completeness:** The model-generated plan includes additional unnecessary steps (e.g., placing the cube in a holder, turning a holder, etc.) that are unrelated to fulfilling the goal. However, it does include one cube rotation instruction (rotating the cube till the green face upward), which is partially aligned with the task goal. The second essential cube rotation specified in the ground-truth plan is entirely missing.  
  2. **Correctness:** The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan introduces invalid steps (e.g., putting the cube in the holder, rotating the holder) that are neither logical nor required for achieving the stated task goal. Furthermore, the inclusion of "rotate the cube till the green face upward" deviates from rotating it twice for 90° as per the ground-truth plan. This plan lacks adherence to logical and sequential correctness.  
  3. **Clarity:** While the steps are described in a way understandable to a low-level executor, their relevance is unclear and detracts from the clarity. Additionally, the cube rotation described ("rotate the cube till the green face upward") is ambiguous and not precise in indicating the degrees of rotation required. However, clarity in action formulation for low-level executors marginally improves the score in this area
