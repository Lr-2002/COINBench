# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cross-WithStick-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick
Step 2: align it with the nearst entry
Step 3: push the cube till the next entry
Step 4: aligh the stick with the next entry
Step 5: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Position the stick behind the green cube.
Step 2: Push the green cube along the first segment of the cross-shaped path.
Step 3: Adjust the stick's position to align with the next segment of the path.
Step 4: Push the green cube along the second segment of the path.
Step 5: Adjust the stick's position to align with the final segment of the path.
Step 6: Push the green cube to the target position marked with the red circle.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 85/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan captures all essential steps to achieve the task goal. However, some details from the ground-truth plan, such as explicitly "aligning the stick with the nearest entry," are generalized as "adjusting the stick." While functional overlap exists, the omission of precision in describing entry alignment marks a minor deviation.  
  - **Correctness:** The model-generated steps are logically and sequentially valid, following a coherent order compatible with the goal. However, replacing distinct alignment actions per entry with an overarching "adjust" step introduces some ambiguity that could cause a slight structural inaccuracy in a complex setup.  
  - **Clarity:** Instructions like "Position the stick behind the green cube" and "Adjust the stick's position to align with the path" are not explicitly broken down into low-level executor-compatible steps (e.g., "align the stick with the nearest entry"). This reduces interpretability for simple robotic controllers accustomed to basic action-object instructions. Using terms like "path" and "segment" assumes higher-level comprehension, detracting from step-by-step clarity
