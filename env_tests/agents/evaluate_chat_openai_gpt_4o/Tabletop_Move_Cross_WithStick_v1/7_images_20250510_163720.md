# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cross-WithStick-v1 (7 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick
Step 2: align it with the nearst entry
Step 3: push the cube till the next entry
Step 4: aligh the stick with the next entry
Step 5: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pull the pivot to the target area
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 20/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 40/100
- Mean Score: 30/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan significantly omits essential steps outlined in the ground-truth plan, such as picking up the stick, aligning it with entries, and sequentially pushing the cube through various entries until it reaches the marker. Instead, it introduces a single, unrelated step ("pull the pivot to the target area") which does not directly align with the goal of moving the cube across the tabletop using a stick. Consequently, the plan is incomplete and only partially correct due to its misalignment with task objectives. While the single step is clearly described (suitable for execution by a low-level robot), it lacks clarity in representing the overall task goal
