# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cross-WithStick-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick
Step 2: align it with the nearst entry
Step 3: push the cube till the next entry
Step 4: aligh the stick with the next entry
Step 5: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Align the stick with the small cube.
Step 2: Push the small cube along the horizontal segment of the cross-shaped path.
Step 3: Adjust the stick's position to align with the vertical segment of the path.
Step 4: Push the small cube along the vertical segment towards the target position.
Step 5: Verify the cube is at the target position.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 85/100
- Correctness: 75/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 73/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes most of the essential steps needed to move the cube to the target position, such as aligning the stick and pushing the cube along the cross-shaped path. However, it omits a clear initial step to "pick the stick," which is required to begin the task. Additionally, it doesn't explicitly address re-alignment for every entry point as per the human-annotated plan.  
  - **Correctness**: While most steps are logically ordered (align → push → re-align → push), the sequence deviates partially from the ground truth. The ground-truth plan specifies aligning the stick with the "nearest entry" first, which is clearer and more direct, whereas the model-generated plan introduces a less-clear approach referencing alignment with the "small cube" at first. This could lead to missteps if contexts were misinterpreted.  
  - **Clarity**: The model-generated plan uses vague descriptions like "align with the small cube" and "adjust the stick's position," which are less actionable for the low-level executor compared to the structured action-object commands in the ground-truth plan. The task-specific low-level language such as "push the cube till the next entry" and "align the stick with the next entry" is absent, making it harder to translate into executable steps
