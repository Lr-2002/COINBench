# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cross-WithStick-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick
Step 2: align it with the nearst entry
Step 3: push the cube till the next entry
Step 4: aligh the stick with the next entry
Step 5: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the stick
Step 2: position the stick near the green cube
Step 3: push the green cube along the cross-shaped path
Step 4: align the green cube with the target position
Step 5: release the stick
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 65/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 40/100
- Mean Score: 52/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan is missing essential steps and logical structuring compared to the ground-truth plan, significantly reducing its completeness and correctness. Furthermore, the clarity suffers due to vague phrasing and departure from the low-level instruction format. The ground-truth plan is more precise and stepwise, while the model plan attempts to summarize or abstract details, which limits its utility

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 65/100**  
  The model-generated plan captures the general theme of pushing the cube to the target but skips key intermediate steps from the ground-truth plan, such as aligning the stick with each entry point in the cross-shaped path. It also lacks specificity in addressing all required steps towards the goal.

- **Correctness: 50/100**  
  The sequential logic in the model-generated plan breaks down due to missing transitions and misaligned step order. For instance, the step "align the green cube with the target position" is logically flawed, as the stick is the tool being manipulated, not the cube. The order of operations also doesn’t match the structured progression observed in the ground truth. The step “release the stick” is irrelevant as per the low-level instructions format.

- **Clarity: 40/100**  
  Instructions like "position the stick near the green cube" and "push the green cube along the cross-shaped path" are partially vague and fail to adhere strictly to the low-level executor format (e.g., "push the cube till the next entry"). These deviations introduce ambiguity, making it less clear for a low-level executor to follow the generated plan without further clarification.

- **Mean Score: 51.7/100**

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan is missing essential steps and logical structuring compared to the ground-truth plan, significantly reducing its completeness and correctness. Furthermore, the clarity suffers due to vague phrasing and departure from the low-level instruction format. The ground-truth plan is more precise and stepwise, while the model plan attempts to summarize or abstract details, which limits its utility.
