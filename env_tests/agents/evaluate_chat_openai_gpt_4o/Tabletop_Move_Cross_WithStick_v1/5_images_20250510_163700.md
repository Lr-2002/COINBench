# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cross-WithStick-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick
Step 2: align it with the nearst entry
Step 3: push the cube till the next entry
Step 4: aligh the stick with the next entry
Step 5: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Position the stick near the small cube.
Step 2: Push the small cube along the first segment of the cross-shaped path.
Step 3: Adjust the stick's position to align with the next segment of the path.
Step 4: Push the small cube along the second segment of the path.
Step 5: Repeat the adjustment and pushing process for the remaining segments of the path.
Step 6: Push the small cube to the target position marked with the red circle.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 75/100
- Mean Score: 83/100

## Justification
**
  The model-generated plan is well-structured and mostly complete but falls short in explicitly defining all atomic actions (e.g., "pick the stick") and providing clear, low-level instructions for a robotic executor. While it captures the general logic of the task, its lack of precision and actionable clarity compared to the ground truth impacts its overall evaluation

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 90/100**
  The model-generated plan includes all essential steps to accomplish the task. It implicitly aligns with the detailed goal of moving the cube using the stick across a cross-shaped path to the marker. However, it lacks the explicit initial step to "pick the stick," which the ground-truth plan includes. This omission might lead to execution errors unless the stick is already in the correct position when the plan starts.

- **Correctness: 85/100**
  The steps are largely logically and sequentially correct, but compared to the ground-truth plan, the order and specificity of actions are less precise. For example, the model's Step 1 ("Position the stick...") is vague compared to the explicit instruction "pick the stick" in the ground-truth plan. Additionally, the instruction to "repeat the adjustment and pushing process" could be interpreted as iterative, but specifying the number of segments (as the ground-truth plan does) would ensure clarity.

- **Clarity: 75/100**
  While the steps are described in basic language, they are not entirely clear or low-level enough for a low-level executor. For example, "Position the stick..." and "Repeat the adjustment and pushing process..." are vague and do not map directly to executable low-level actions such as "pick the stick" or "align the stick with the next entry." The lack of defined atomic actions makes the plan less executable compared to the ground-truth plan.

- **Mean Score: 83.3/100**

- **Justification:**
