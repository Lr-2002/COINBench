# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cross-WithStick-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick
Step 2: align it with the nearst entry
Step 3: push the cube till the next entry
Step 4: aligh the stick with the next entry
Step 5: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the stick
Step 2: use the stick to push the small cube along the cross-shaped path
Step 3: move the small cube to the target position
Step 4: release the stick
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan lacks sufficient granularity and omits essential intermediary steps present in the ground-truth plan, such as "align the stick with the nearest entry" and subsequent alignment steps. These details are critical for ensuring accuracy in subtasks like moving the cube across the cross-shaped path.  
  - **Correctness**: The high-level sequence of actions is generally correct, but the order and logical progression are overly generalized. Steps such as "use the stick to push the cube" do not specify intermediate adjustments or alignment tasks required to make the movement logically correct.  
  - **Clarity**: While the plan uses simple language, it lacks the necessary detail and precision for a low-level executor. For example, "use the stick to push the small cube along the cross-shaped path" is not a direct action instruction that can be understood by an executor requiring statements like "<action> the <object>."
