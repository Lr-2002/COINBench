# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cross-WithStick-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick
Step 2: align it with the nearst entry
Step 3: push the cube till the next entry
Step 4: aligh the stick with the next entry
Step 5: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Position the stick near the small cube.
Step 2: Push the cube along the first segment of the cross-shaped path.
Step 3: Adjust the stick's position to align with the next segment of the path.
Step 4: Push the cube along the second segment of the path.
Step 5: Repeat the process for subsequent segments of the path until the cube reaches the target position.
Step 6: Verify the cube is correctly placed at the target position.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 80/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 78/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan does cover the key steps, but its omissions (e.g., picking up the stick) cause partial incompleteness. Sequential correctness is retained overall, though imprecise repetitions slightly detract from clarity. Clarity scores are lower because of the lack of low-level executor-friendly phrasing and ambiguity introduced by generalizations. It is functional but less effective than the explicitly detailed ground-truth plan

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 80/100  
The model-generated plan includes all major steps to achieve the goal (pushing the cube to the marker using the stick and navigating the cross-shaped path). However, it does not explicitly mention "picking the stick" or "align it with the entry," steps that are critical to initiate the task. It assumes the setup is already aligned but lacks explicit details of this setup phase.  

- **Correctness**: 85/100  
The steps in the model-generated plan are generally logically and sequentially correct. It follows a proper order for using the stick to navigate the path with the cube. However, thereâ€™s an overgeneralization in the repeated steps ("Repeat the process for subsequent segments"), which makes it slightly ambiguous when compared to the precise segment-by-segment instructions in the ground-truth plan. The final verification step, while useful, adds minor redundancy not found in the ground-truth plan.  

- **Clarity**: 70/100  
While the plan is understandable and moderately clear, it lacks precise low-level task descriptions. Instructions such as "push the cube" and "adjust the stick's position" are vague compared to the low-level executor-friendly phrasing of the ground-truth plan. Actions like "align the stick" are better described in a way that explicitly specifies the alignment target. Additionally, the phrase "Repeat the process" could confuse the executor since it does not explicitly detail actions for each specific entry or segment.  

- **Mean Score**: 78.33/100  

- **Justification**:
