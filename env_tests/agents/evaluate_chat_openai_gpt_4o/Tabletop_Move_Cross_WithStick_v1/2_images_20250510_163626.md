# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cross-WithStick-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick
Step 2: align it with the nearst entry
Step 3: push the cube till the next entry
Step 4: aligh the stick with the next entry
Step 5: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Use the stick to push the cube along the first segment of the cross-shaped path.
Step 2: Adjust the stick's position to align with the next segment of the path.
Step 3: Push the cube along the second segment of the path.
Step 4: Adjust the stick's position to align with the third segment of the path.
Step 5: Push the cube along the third segment of the path.
Step 6: Adjust the stick's position to align with the final segment of the path.
Step 7: Push the cube to the target position marked with the red circle.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 82/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan performs well in capturing the high-level logic of the task but falls short in precise execution requirements. The absence of an explicit "pick the stick" step impacts its Completeness and Correctness. Additionally, the phrasing of instructions lacks the clarity and format needed for direct execution, which lowers the Clarity score. Overall, the plan is functional but not fully optimized for low-level action execution requirements, as emphasized by the benchmark environment (COIN)

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 90/100  
  The model-generated plan captures all essential actions required to complete the task, including positioning and pushing the cube through different segments of the cross-shaped path. However, the plan skips an explicit step to "pick the stick," which is crucial as per the ground-truth plan. This omission affects the completeness score.  

- **Correctness**: 85/100  
  While the model-generated plan is logically correct and follows the proper sequence of actions (i.e., alignment before pushing the cube for each segment), the plan assumes the stick is already in hand, which creates an implicit dependency not aligned with the ground truth. The failure to address this initial step makes the generated sequence incomplete in a real-world execution context.  

- **Clarity**: 70/100  
  The model-generated steps are fairly descriptive but are not written in the low-level executor format that uses direct action-object phrases, such as "pick the stick," "push the cube till the next entry," or "align the stick with the entry." Phrasing like "Adjust the stick's position" and "Push the cube along the segment of the path" introduces ambiguity and is less actionable for a low-level executor.  

- **Mean Score**: 81.67/100
