# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Open-Cabinet-WithObstacle-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: push the box
Step 2: open the cabinet door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits an essential step, "push the box," which is required to clear the obstacle and allow the cabinet door to open. Without addressing the obstacle, the task cannot be completed, so the plan is incomplete.  
  - **Correctness**: The step provided, "open the cabinet door," is logically correct and sequentially valid. However, since it doesn't account for the obstacle, the execution may fail in realistic settings, which reduces the correctness score.  
  - **Clarity**: The plan's single step is clearly and succinctly stated in a form that the low-level executor can understand. There are no ambiguities, so this aspect scores high
