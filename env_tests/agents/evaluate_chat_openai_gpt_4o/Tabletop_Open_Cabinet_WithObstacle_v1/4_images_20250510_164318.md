# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Open-Cabinet-WithObstacle-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: push the box
Step 2: open the cabinet door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: No action needed.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 0/100
- Correctness: 0/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 17/100

## Justification
**  
   The model plan lacks **Completeness** by omitting essential steps, earns a score of 0 in **Correctness** due to logical inaccuracies, and fails to meet the **Clarity** requirement for low-level executors, despite being somewhat understandable in isolation. Overall, it does not suffice for robotic execution in this benchmark task

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 0/100**  
   The model-generated plan misses both essential actions required to achieve the task goal (pushing the box and opening the cabinet door). This renders the plan incomplete.  

- **Correctness: 0/100**  
   The single step provided, "No action needed," is logically incorrect since it contradicts the subtleties of the task goal, which requires overcoming the obstacle (by pushing the box) and completing the cabinet opening sequence.  

- **Clarity: 50/100**  
   While "No action needed" is clear and concise as an instruction, it fails to communicate the proper actions to the low-level executor. It does not describe actionable steps in the required format.  

- **Mean Score: 16.67/100**  

- **Justification:**  
   The model plan lacks **Completeness** by omitting essential steps, earns a score of 0 in **Correctness** due to logical inaccuracies, and fails to meet the **Clarity** requirement for low-level executors, despite being somewhat understandable in isolation. Overall, it does not suffice for robotic execution in this benchmark task.
