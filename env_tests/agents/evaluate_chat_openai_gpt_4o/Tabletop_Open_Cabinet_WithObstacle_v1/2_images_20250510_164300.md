# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Open-Cabinet-WithObstacle-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: push the box
Step 2: open the cabinet door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 100/100
- Mean Score: 73/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan lacks the step to "push the box," which is an essential prerequisite for opening the cabinet door in the provided Ground-Truth Plan. Hence, the generated plan is incomplete.  
  - **Correctness**: While the step "open the cabinet door" is logically and sequentially correct, omitting the necessary "push the box" action creates a logical gap. The latter action cannot be completed without addressing the obstacle, impacting the logical flow.  
  - **Clarity**: The single step "open the cabinet door" is clear, unambiguous, and directly executable by the low-level executor, adhering to the expected instruction format
