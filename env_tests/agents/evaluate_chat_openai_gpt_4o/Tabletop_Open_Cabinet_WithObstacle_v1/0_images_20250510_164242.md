Step 1: open the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
* **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits a critical step ("push the box") mentioned in the ground-truth plan. This step may be necessary to clear an obstacle before opening the cabinet door, leading to a significant loss of completeness.  
  * **Correctness**: While the single step included ("open the cabinet door") is logically correct and in sequence, it assumes the obstacle has already been addressed, which may not align with the actual task context. This results in a partial deduction.  
  * **Clarity**: The model-generated plan is concise and clear, adhering to the executor-friendly format. However, its lack of contextual grounding could confuse the executor in environments with obstacles
