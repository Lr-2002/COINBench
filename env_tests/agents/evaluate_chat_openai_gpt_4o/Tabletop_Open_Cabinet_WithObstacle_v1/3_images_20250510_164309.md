- Completeness: 0/100
- Correctness: 0/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 17/100

## Justification
1. **Completeness** (0): The model-generated plan omits essential steps provided in the human-annotated ground-truth plan, including pushing the box and opening the cabinet door, which are critical to completing the task.  
  2. **Correctness** (0): The single action "No action needed" is incorrect, as the task goal cannot be achieved without at least pushing the box and opening the cabinet door, as per the ground-truth sequence.  
  3. **Clarity** (50): While "No action needed" is clear in its wording, it fails to provide actionable instructions for the low-level executor as per the required format. However, the language itself is understandable
