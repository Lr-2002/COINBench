# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Book-FromShelf-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate hand to face forward
Step 2: move to the highest book
Step 3: pick the book and place it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan condenses the task but misses important preparatory steps explicitly included in the ground-truth plan, such as "rotate hand to face forward" and "move to the highest book." These steps may be critical for successful execution depending on the environment and constraints.  
  - **Correctness**: The model-generated plan skips intermediate actions and directly combines actions ("find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker"), which may lead to logical or sequential issues if the robot is not positioned correctly or its hand is not aligned. However, the overall goal is technically correct.  
  - **Clarity**: The description is clear and succinct. The phrasing ("find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker") is understandable for a low-level executor, compatible with its instruction format, though slightly verbose due to the combined steps
