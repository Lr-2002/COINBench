# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Book-FromShelf-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate hand to face forward
Step 2: move to the highest book
Step 3: pick the book and place it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
**  
  - *Completeness:* The model-generated plan skips over the intermediate actions, such as rotating the hand to face forward and moving to the highest book. While the plan implies those steps might be handled, it does not explicitly account for them.  
  - *Correctness:* The single-step formulation of the model's plan compresses multiple actions into one, leading to potential loss in logical sequencing and accuracy. For example, it doesn't explicitly ensure that the book is the highest one or that precursor motions like positioning the hand are correctly sequenced.  
  - *Clarity:* The model's plan uses clear and concise language. Its instruction, "find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker," conforms to the low-level executor's format and is understandable, but it lacks detail regarding specific actions.

  Overall, the model plan demonstrates some utility but falls short of the rigor and full explicitness of the ground-truth one.
