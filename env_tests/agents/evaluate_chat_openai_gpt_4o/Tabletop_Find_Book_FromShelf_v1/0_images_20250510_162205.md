## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 80/100

## Justification
**  
  - *Completeness:* The model-generated plan omits specific intermediate steps, such as "rotate hand to face forward" and "move to the highest book." While it still encapsulates the essence of the task ("find and pick the book…"), these missing details might be essential for the low-level executor.
  - *Correctness:* The single line provided by the model does represent a logically correct series of actions, but the lack of explicit sequencing for subtasks (e.g., positioning the hand first) slightly detracts from the exactness of the order.
  - *Clarity:* The instruction is clear and concise, written in a straightforward format that aligns well with the low-level executor's capability
