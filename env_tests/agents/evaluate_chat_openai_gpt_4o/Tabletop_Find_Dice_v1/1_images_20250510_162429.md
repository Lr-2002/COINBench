# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Dice-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate left dice
Step 2: rotate right dice
Step 3: find the dice have 2 and 4 in the corresponding face and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 3: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 65/100
- Mean Score: 45/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan misses several essential steps for achieving the task goal of identifying a dice with the faces "2" and "4" and putting it on the marker. Actions such as identifying the dice and placing it on the marker are entirely absent, and the provided actions seem unrelated to the task goal.  
  - **Correctness**: The steps provided in the model-generated plan lack logical sequencing for the original task. Actions such as "rotate the cube till the blue face upward" do not agree with the task's goal of identifying specific numbers on a dice. The repeated action "pick up the cube, put it in the holder" is redundant and further demonstrates a lack of sequential understanding.  
  - **Clarity**: The model-generated plan uses clear and understandable instructions that align well with the format required by the low-level executor. However, the clarity score is limited by the lack of coherence with the task goal, reducing its overall utility
