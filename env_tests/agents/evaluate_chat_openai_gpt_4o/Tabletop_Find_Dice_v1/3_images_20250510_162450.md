# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Dice-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate left dice
Step 2: rotate right dice
Step 3: find the dice have 2 and 4 in the corresponding face and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Inspect the red dice to check if it has 2 and 4 points on corresponding faces.
Step 2: Inspect the white dice to check if it has 2 and 4 points on corresponding faces.
Step 3: Pick up the correct dice.
Step 4: Put the dice on the marker.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 80/100
- Correctness: 75/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 83/100

## Justification
- **Completeness** loses points for omitting the essential rotation step, which is fundamental to achieving the task goal.  
- **Correctness** is compromised by the absence of dice rotation, as it affects the logical progression for completing the task.  
- **Clarity** is almost ideal, as the model-produced instructions are articulated in an executor-friendly manner, even if they miss essential details.

## Raw GPT Response

### Evaluation of Model-Generated Plan:

#### Completeness: **80/100**  
The model-generated plan covers most necessary actions, including inspecting both dice, picking up the correct one, and putting it on the marker. However, it omits the rotation of the dice, which is explicitly required in the ground-truth plan to check different faces effectively. This omission compromises the completeness for achieving the task goal.

#### Correctness: **75/100**  
The sequence of inspecting the dice and putting the correct one on the marker is logically correct. However, the omission of the rotation step introduces a logical flaw, as the dice may not be properly oriented for identifying the correct faces. Without including this step, the sequential reasoning is incomplete for the task.

#### Clarity: **95/100**  
The model-generated instructions use clear and understandable language that aligns well with the low-level executor's requirements. Each step is action-oriented and adheres to the format expected by the robot. For example, actions like "Inspect the dice" and "Put the dice on the marker" are concise and actionable. The clarity is the strongest aspect of the model-generated plan.

#### Mean Score: **83.33/100**  

#### Justification:  
- **Completeness** loses points for omitting the essential rotation step, which is fundamental to achieving the task goal.  
- **Correctness** is compromised by the absence of dice rotation, as it affects the logical progression for completing the task.  
- **Clarity** is almost ideal, as the model-produced instructions are articulated in an executor-friendly manner, even if they miss essential details.  

The model demonstrates good clarity but needs improvement in capturing all task-relevant actions and their logical ordering.
