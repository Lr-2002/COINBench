# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Dice-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate left dice
Step 2: rotate right dice
Step 3: find the dice have 2 and 4 in the corresponding face and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Search for the dice in the visible area.
Step 2: If the dice is not found, open the drawer.
Step 3: If the dice is still not found, open the cabinet door.
Step 4: Once the dice is located, pick up the dice.
Step 5: Put the dice on the marker.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 67/100

## Justification
- **Completeness** was rated lower due to the absence of essential steps to complete the task goal, such as identifying and orienting the dice correctly.  
- **Correctness** had a higher score because the plan is logically sequential and could accurately locate and retrieve the dice, but it fails to adequately address the manipulation required for task completion.  
- **Clarity** scored the highest because the instructions are well-aligned with the low-level executor’s capabilities, but it lost points for not including sufficient detail about dice orientation actions.

### Evaluation of the Model-Generated Plan:

#### Completeness: 50/100  
The model-generated plan searches for the dice and places it on the marker, but it lacks steps required to manipulate the dice (e.g., rotating the dice to identify and position the corresponding faces "2" and "4"). The ground-truth plan explicitly handles these essential steps for ensuring the correct dice orientation, which is missing in the model-generated plan.

#### Correctness: 70/100  
The model-generated plan follows a logical sequence for locating the dice by checking visible areas, then opening storage spaces (drawer or cabinet) if necessary. However, it fails to ensure that the dice is appropriately manipulated to fulfill the task goal (finding the dice with faces "2" and "4" on corresponding sides). While the sequence is sensible, the task goal is incomplete.

#### Clarity: 80/100  
The steps are described clearly in simple, low-level instructions that align well with the capabilities of the low-level executor. However, the omission of dice rotation actions removes critical clarity about achieving the actual task goal. The executor might not understand that dice manipulation is necessary.

#### Mean Score: 66.7/100  

#### Justification:  
- **Completeness** was rated lower due to the absence of essential steps to complete the task goal, such as identifying and orienting the dice correctly.  
- **Correctness** had a higher score because the plan is logically sequential and could accurately locate and retrieve the dice, but it fails to adequately address the manipulation required for task completion.  
- **Clarity** scored the highest because the instructions are well-aligned with the low-level executor’s capabilities, but it lost points for not including sufficient detail about dice orientation actions.  

Overall, the model-generated plan captures the initial part of the goal but falls short on addressing the full scope of the task requirements.
