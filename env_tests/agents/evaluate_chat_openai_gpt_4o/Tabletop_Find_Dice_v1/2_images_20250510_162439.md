# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Dice-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate left dice
Step 2: rotate right dice
Step 3: find the dice have 2 and 4 in the corresponding face and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the red die till the face with 2 points is visible
Step 2: pick up the red die and put it on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
- *Completeness*: The model-generated plan is missing significant portions of the task. It only accounts for handling one die (red die) and doesn't include instructions for the other die or ensuring both 2 and 4 are on the corresponding faces as specified in the task goal.  
  - *Correctness*: While the actions for the red die are logically sequential, the plan lacks instructions for manipulating the second die. Additionally, skipping these steps undermines the overall logical flow of the task goal.  
  - *Clarity*: Individual steps are written in a manner the low-level executor can understand ("rotate the red die," "pick up the red die and put it on the marker"). However, there is a mild ambiguity as it doesn't fully articulate finding both dice with the required faces.

The model-generated plan is partial and focuses on a subset of the overall task but fails to address the entirety of the ground-truth plan adequately.
