# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Line-WithStick-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and aligh it with the line entry
Step 2: push the cube till the cube achieve the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the stick
Step 2: position the stick behind the small cube
Step 3: push the small cube along the straight line path towards the target position
Step 4: adjust the stick to ensure the cube is aligned with the target position
Step 5: place the stick back on the table
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 85/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan is mostly robust and includes all necessary actions to fulfill the task, with a small deviation from the essential steps. There is a slight redundancy in execution order, and certain descriptions could be better adapted to the executor-level language constraints. Despite these minor flaws, the plan demonstrates a high level of competence in addressing the task

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 90/100**  
  The model-generated plan includes all essential steps required to accomplish the task but introduces an extra step (Step 5: place the stick back on the table), which is not present in the ground-truth plan. While this isn't strictly necessary to achieve the task goal, it enriches the execution slightly and does not compromise the plan's completeness.

- **Correctness: 85/100**  
  The sequence is mostly logically and sequentially correct. However, Step 4 (adjust the stick for alignment) seems redundant, as the core alignment should have already been accomplished during the push operation in Step 3. This could make the sequence less optimal compared to the ground-truth plan. Nonetheless, the order is functional and plausible.

- **Clarity: 80/100**  
  The descriptions are reasonably clear, but certain steps like "adjust the stick to ensure the cube is aligned with the target position" and "position the stick behind the small cube" could be rephrased for better alignment with the low-level executor (e.g., "align the stick with the cube" or "push the cube to the target area"). Some steps deviate slightly from the expected <action> the <object> format preferred by the executor.

- **Mean Score: 85/100**
