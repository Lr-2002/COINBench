# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Line-WithStick-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and aligh it with the line entry
Step 2: push the cube till the cube achieve the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Position the stick near the small cube.
Step 2: Push the small cube along the straight-line path using the stick.
Step 3: Adjust the stick's position as needed to ensure the cube stays on the path.
Step 4: Continue pushing the cube until it reaches the target position.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 85/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 78/100

## Justification
**  
  - The model-generated plan reasonably captures the overall intent of the task but is missing explicit reference to certain essential steps (e.g., aligning the stick explicitly with the line).  
  - While most steps are in logical order, some details are implied rather than clearly communicated, and additional, unnecessary steps were introduced.  
  - The phrasing lacks conformity with the simple, action-object-focused language required by the low-level executor. The lack of precision diminishes clarity

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness:** 85/100  
  The model-generated plan includes most of the key steps required to accomplish the task but adds an unnecessary adjustment step ("Adjust the stick's position as needed"), which isn't specified in the ground-truth plan. Additionally, the explicit alignment step ("align it with the line entry") from the ground-truth is omitted, which may lead to ambiguity about starting correctly.

- **Correctness:** 80/100  
  Although the general sequence of events is logical (first position, then push the cube, and finally ensure the cube reaches the target), the steps are slightly reordered compared to the logical flow in the ground-truth plan. For instance, aligning the stick with the path is implied rather than explicitly stated earlier in the task.

- **Clarity:** 70/100  
  The steps are somewhat clear, but the use of terms such as "adjust the stickâ€™s position" and "straight-line path" might not be directly interpretable by a low-level executor following specific instructions like "<action> the <object>". The phrasing deviates from the concrete actions described in the ground-truth plan, reducing clarity.

- **Mean Score:** 78.33/100
