# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Line-WithStick-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and aligh it with the line entry
Step 2: push the cube till the cube achieve the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Align the stick with the small green cube.
Step 2: Push the small green cube gently along the straight line path using the stick.
Step 3: Continue pushing the cube until it reaches the target position marked with the red circle.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 88/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan captures the essence of the task and includes appropriate steps but introduces some additional specificity and descriptive language, which may complicate execution for a low-level executor. It maintains logical flow and clarity but could benefit from stricter adherence to task simplicity

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 90/100**  
The model-generated plan includes the essential steps for the task but adds extra specificity. While it still achieves the goal and doesn't miss any critical steps, the alignment described in Step 1 could inadvertently imply a redundant subgoal that was unnecessary in the ground-truth plan.  

- **Correctness: 90/100**  
The sequence of steps is logically correct, and the model maintains a proper order to achieve the task goal. However, the phrasing in Step 1 might mislead the low-level executor into engaging with a "small green cube" rather than focusing on the general stick alignment with the line entry, creating potential confusion.  

- **Clarity: 85/100**  
The description is clear and has sufficient detail, but it introduces ambiguities for a low-level executor. The reference to "gently" and "straight line path" in Step 2 makes it harder for a strict low-level executor to follow step-by-step instructions exactly. The ground-truth plan is more concise and directly executable.  

- **Mean Score: 88.33/100**  

- **Justification:**  
The model-generated plan captures the essence of the task and includes appropriate steps but introduces some additional specificity and descriptive language, which may complicate execution for a low-level executor. It maintains logical flow and clarity but could benefit from stricter adherence to task simplicity.
