# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Line-WithStick-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and aligh it with the line entry
Step 2: push the cube till the cube achieve the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Position the stick near the green cube.
Step 2: Push the green cube along the straight line path using the stick.
Step 3: Adjust the stick's position if necessary to ensure the cube stays on the path.
Step 4: Continue pushing the cube until it reaches the target position.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 75/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 65/100
- Mean Score: 73/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan demonstrates reasonable completeness and correctness but falls short in clarity due to the lack of detailed, low-level executor-compatible phrasing. While the plan includes helpful additional steps to ensure robustness (like adjusting the stick), it could confuse the low-level executor without action-object specificity. The plan is logical and would likely complete the task, but it risks misinterpretation during execution

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 75/100**  
  While the model-generated plan includes more detailed steps (e.g., adjusting the stick's position), it introduces redundancy that was not explicitly required in the ground-truth plan. However, it does cover all the essential actions needed to achieve the task goal: positioning the stick, pushing the cube, and ensuring the cube reaches the target. The additional adjustments may be useful but weren’t part of the minimal steps in the ground truth.  

- **Correctness: 80/100**  
  The general sequence of actions (positioning, pushing, adjusting, continuing) appears logically valid and aligns with the task goal. However, there is some ambiguity in how "adjust the stick's position" fits sequentially with the low-level executor's requirement of taking specific step-by-step actions — the higher abstraction might cause confusion for strict sequential logic. Importantly, the order is correct.  

- **Clarity: 65/100**  
  The steps provided in the model-generated plan aren't explicitly formatted in a way that matches instructions understandable by the low-level executor. Phrases like "Position the stick near the green cube" and "Adjust the stick's position" lack the precise action-object grammar required (e.g., "pick the stick and move it near the cube," or "rotate the stick to correct alignment"). These broader descriptions could introduce ambiguity for a robot that requires strictly actionable commands.

- **Mean Score: 73.3/100**
