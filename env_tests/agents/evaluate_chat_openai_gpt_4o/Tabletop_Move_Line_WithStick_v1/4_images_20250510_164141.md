# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Line-WithStick-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and aligh it with the line entry
Step 2: push the cube till the cube achieve the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Position the stick near the small cube.
Step 2: Push the small cube along the straight line path using the stick.
Step 3: Adjust the stick's position if necessary to keep the cube moving toward the target.
Step 4: Continue pushing the cube until it reaches the target position.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
Although the model-generated plan provides a high-level outline that covers most necessary steps to complete the task, it omits the crucial step of picking up the stick, which negatively affects completeness. The logical flow is mostly correct, but ambiguity in the description (e.g., "Adjust the stick's position") reduces clarity for low-level execution. The ground-truth plan is more direct and better aligned with the low-level executor's requirements

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 70/100  
The model-generated plan includes most essential steps for achieving the goal of moving the cube along the line to the target position. However, it lacks a clear instruction to pick up the stick explicitly, which is a crucial initial step present in the ground-truth plan.

- **Correctness**: 80/100  
The sequence of steps logically progresses toward the goal, with the stick being positioned near the cube first, followed by pushing the cube along the path. However, the step "Adjust the stick's position" is vague and could potentially disrupt logical sequencing because no explicit action tells you if or how you'd re-enter alignment.

- **Clarity**: 60/100  
While the instructions are understandable at a high level, the use of vague terms like "Position the stick" and "Adjust the stick's position" could cause ambiguity for a low-level executor that requires clear, actionable steps akin to "<action> the <object>". Explicit language like "Pick up the stick and align it with the line" from the ground-truth plan is more appropriate.

- **Mean Score**: 70/100  

- **Justification**: Although the model-generated plan provides a high-level outline that covers most necessary steps to complete the task, it omits the crucial step of picking up the stick, which negatively affects completeness.
