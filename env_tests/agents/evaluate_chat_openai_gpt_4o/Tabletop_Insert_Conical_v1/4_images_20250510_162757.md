# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-Conical-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the bottle up 
Step 2: align the bottle with the holder
Step 3: place the bottle down
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the bottle and put it on the marker
Step 2: put the ball into the container
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 25/100
- Correctness: 20/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 35/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan fails to include the essential steps of "aligning the bottle with the holder" and "placing the bottle down," which are core to achieving the task goal (Tabletop-Insert-Conical-v1). The generated steps are incomplete and irrelevant.  
  - **Correctness**: The sequence is incorrect as the actions ("pick up the bottle and put it on the marker"; "put the ball into the container") are unrelated to the ground-truth task and go against the logical progression needed for the task.  
  - **Clarity**: Although the instructions are clearly expressed in low-level executor-compatible language, the actions described do not contribute to the task's completion. Thus, clarity earns a higher score, but it does not compensate for the lack of relevance or correctness
