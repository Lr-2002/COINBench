# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-Conical-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the bottle up 
Step 2: align the bottle with the holder
Step 3: place the bottle down
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: align the conical object with the container
Step 2: lower the conical object into the container
Step 3: release the conical object
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 78/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan partially addresses the task but omits an explicit step to "pick the bottle up," which is critical. The ground-truth plan begins with this essential step, highlighting a gap in the model's proposal.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence of steps provided by the model makes logical sense for the insertion process, but it assumes the object is already in hand, skipping the crucial preparatory step of picking up the object, which could disrupt execution.  
  - **Clarity:** The model's steps are clearly and concisely phrased in a low-level executor-friendly manner, adhering to the required template, which boosts clarity. However, some ambiguity arises from the term "conical object" since the task specifically involves a bottle.

The model-generated plan demonstrates good clarity and partially correct sequencing but lacks completeness due to the missing initial step outlined in the ground truth.
