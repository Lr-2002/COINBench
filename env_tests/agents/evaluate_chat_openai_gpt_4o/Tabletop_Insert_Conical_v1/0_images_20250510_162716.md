# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Insert-Conical-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the bottle up 
Step 2: align the bottle with the holder
Step 3: place the bottle down
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: locate the conical object
Step 2: locate the container
Step 3: pick up the conical object
Step 4: put the conical object into the container
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** While the model-generated plan covers the full sequence for placing an object into a container, it doesn't reference the specific "bottle" or "holder" elements described in the task goal or ground-truth plan. This divergence from the precise objects reduces its completeness with respect to the original task description.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence of steps in the model-generated plan is logically coherent for inserting a generic conical object into a container, but it deviates significantly from the ordered actions in the ground-truth plan (e.g., "align the object with the holder" is missing). This introduces logical misalignment with the expected task.  
  - **Clarity:** The model-generated plan uses clear and low-level executor-compatible instructions (e.g., "pick up the conical object," "put the conical object into the container"). However, there is potential for ambiguity since it deviates from the specific objects in the task description (e.g., "bottle" and "holder")
