```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 73/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan is missing the critical step of "close the door." The goal involves first ensuring that the regular door is closed before handling the cabinet door. Since an essential step is omitted, a score of 50 is given, as the plan partly addresses the task.  
  - **Correctness**: While the step "open the cabinet door" is valid and ordered correctly within the model's generated plan, the absence of the first step impacts its correctness in the overall sequence. Thus, it earns a reduced score of 80.  
  - **Clarity**: The single step "open the cabinet door" is clear and well-suited for the low-level executor to understand and perform. It completely aligns with the provided instruction style, warranting a high score of 90
