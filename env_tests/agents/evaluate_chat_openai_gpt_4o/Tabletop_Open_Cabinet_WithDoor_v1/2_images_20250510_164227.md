Step 1: open the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 100/100
- Mean Score: 67/100

## Justification
- *Completeness*: The model-generated plan includes the essential step "open the cabinet door," which is crucial to achieving the task goal. However, it omits the prior action "close the door," which is listed in the ground-truth plan. As the overall task might assume the door being already open (unclear from the context), partial credit is given.  
  - *Correctness*: The sequence in the model-generated plan is logically correct since "open the cabinet door" is a viable step. However, it skips the necessary prior action of "close the door," presuming that the setup allows for proceeding directly to opening the cabinet door. It does not align with the sequential logic of the ground-truth plan, so it's partially correct.  
  - *Clarity*: The single step "open the cabinet door" is clear, concise, and understandable by the low-level executor
