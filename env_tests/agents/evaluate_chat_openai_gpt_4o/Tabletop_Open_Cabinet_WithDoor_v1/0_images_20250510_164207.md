# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Open-Cabinet-WithDoor-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: close the door
Step 2: open the cabinet door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan misses an essential step, "close the door," which prevents the task goal of the tabletop-cabinet task from being fully completed as per the ground-truth plan. This omission significantly affects the completeness score.  
  - **Correctness**: While the step included in the model-generated plan ("open the cabinet door") is logically and sequentially correct, the plan assumes that the prior step ("close the door") has already been completed, which is unclear from the context. Depending on execution state, missing this step risks logical inconsistency.  
  - **Clarity**: The model-generated step is described in a clear and understandable way ("open the cabinet door"), adhering to the accepted instruction format for the low-level executor. This clarity is reflected in the high score for this criterion
