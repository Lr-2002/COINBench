# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Open-Cabinet-WithDoor-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: close the door
Step 2: open the cabinet door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 100/100
- Mean Score: 67/100

## Justification
**  
  - *Completeness:* The model-generated plan misses the essential first step from the ground-truth plan, which is to "close the door" before opening the cabinet door. This omission significantly impacts the plan's completeness, as not performing the first step could result in failure to execute the task correctly if the door is open.  
  - *Correctness:* While the single step provided by the model—"open the cabinet door"—is logically correct and sequentially valid, it presumes the first step has already been completed or is irrelevant. This assumption makes the sequence incomplete and less reliable. Correctness is penalized due to the problematic assumption.  
  - *Clarity:* The single step given is clearly described and follows the expected format for low-level execution, earning full marks for clarity
