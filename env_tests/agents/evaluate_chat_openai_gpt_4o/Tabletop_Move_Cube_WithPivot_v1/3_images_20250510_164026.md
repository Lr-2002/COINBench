# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithPivot-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and push it between two cylinder on the desk
Step 2: rotate the stick till the cube on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pull the pivot to the target area
Step 2: adjust the pivot to push the cube toward the marker
Step 3: ensure the cube is aligned with the marker
Step 4: finalize the cube's position on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 40/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The ground-truth plan specifies two essential steps: manipulating the stick as a pivot and rotating it to align the cube on the marker. The model-generated plan adds additional steps (e.g., "pull the pivot to the target area," "ensure the cube is aligned with the marker") but omits the specified action of explicitly rotating a stick or interfacing with specific objects like cylinders in the environment. While the additional steps can make sense in certain contexts, these are ambiguities not directly tied to ensuring task completion with all required actions.  
  - **Correctness:** The ground-truth plan is logically and sequentially clear, but the model-generated plan assumes some ambiguities by shifting to a higher-level abstraction (e.g., "adjust the pivot" and "finalize the cube's position") without defining strict actions. The sequence also doesn't strictly correspond to the expected low-level mechanical flow (e.g., intermediary handling of the stick in relation to cylinders is unclear).  
  - **Clarity:** The ground-truth plan uses low-level execution-friendly instructions, but steps in the model-generated plan are not as clear or specific. For example, "ensure the cube is aligned with the marker" and "finalize the cube's position" do not map well to low-level instructions understandable by the executor. While correctly hinting at goals, the lack of concrete actions reduces clarity
