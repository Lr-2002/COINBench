# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithPivot-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and push it between two cylinder on the desk
Step 2: rotate the stick till the cube on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: pull the pivot to the target area
Step 4: pick the apple to the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 25/100
- Correctness: 20/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 32/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan lacks essential steps (pushing the stick and rotating it to position the cube), deviates substantially from the required task logic, and includes irrelevant actions (e.g., picking the apple). While the individual steps are syntactically clear, the plan as a whole is incomplete, incorrect, and fails to address the task goal effectively

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 25/100**  
  The ground-truth plan involves using the stick to manipulate the cube indirectly (pushing it between two cylinders) and then rotating the stick to position the cube. The model-generated plan does not address these specific requirements. While it contains some plausible manipulation actions, it does not cover the essential steps to achieve the task of "moving the cube with the pivot." Most notably, the use of a cube and a holder deviates from the ground-truth action sequence, and the mention of unrelated actions like picking the apple detracts from goal relevance.

- **Correctness: 20/100**  
  The model-generated sequence includes actions in a logical order, but the steps do not align with or achieve the task objective. The cube manipulation starts incorrectly by "putting it in the holder," and subsequent actions like "rotating the holder till the hole upward" and "pulling the pivot to the target area" fail to follow the intent of the task, which involves indirect manipulation of the cube via the pivot. Additionally, step 4 ("pick the apple to the marker") is completely irrelevant to the goal.

- **Clarity: 50/100**  
  The individual steps are described in a way the low-level executor can understand, with clear syntax and action-object pairs. However, the lack of task relevance and the inclusion of unnecessary actions reduce overall clarity for accomplishing the specific task goal.

- **Mean Score: 31.67/100**  

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan lacks essential steps (pushing the stick and rotating it to position the cube), deviates substantially from the required task logic, and includes irrelevant actions (e.g., picking the apple). While the individual steps are syntactically clear, the plan as a whole is incomplete, incorrect, and fails to address the task goal effectively.
