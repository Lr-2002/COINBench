# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithPivot-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and push it between two cylinder on the desk
Step 2: rotate the stick till the cube on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pull the pivot to the target area
Step 2: align the cube with the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 30/100
- Mean Score: 40/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan lacks critical steps ("pick the stick and rotate it") found in the ground-truth plan, reducing **Completeness**. While its sequence is logical, it diverges from the necessary order for achieving the task goal, impacting **Correctness**. Finally, **Clarity** suffers due to vague descriptions unsuitable for the low-level executor, especially for "align the cube with the marker." The average score reflects the overall deficiencies in the model-generated plan across all criteria

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness:** 40/100  
  The model-generated plan omits essential steps present in the ground-truth plan, such as "pick the stick and push it between two cylinders on the desk." It assumes that the pivot is already available at the target area, leaving gaps for task execution. Additionally, the alignment step is unclear whether it involves moving or manipulating the cube, deviating from the original goal.

- **Correctness:** 50/100  
  While the sequence appears logical (pulling the pivot first, aligning the cube next), it lacks adherence to the ground-truth procedure. The step "rotate the stick till the cube on the marker" from the ground-truth plan is missing altogether, hindering proper execution. The order is not necessarily wrong but incomplete.

- **Clarity:** 30/100  
  The actions described in the plan ("pull the pivot to the target area" and "align the cube with the marker") are vague and lack clarity for a low-level executor. For instance, "align the cube with the marker" doesn't specify precisely *how* the alignment is to be performed and whether the cube must be rotated, pushed, or positioned. The instructions are not actionable in terms of low-level commands.

- **Mean Score:** 40/100
