# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithPivot-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and push it between two cylinder on the desk
Step 2: rotate the stick till the cube on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pull the pivot to the target area
Step 2: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 3: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 4: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 5: pick the apple to the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 75/100
- Mean Score: 62/100

## Justification
**  
    - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan includes several steps that are irrelevant to the ground-truth goal (e.g., "pick the apple to the marker") and omits essential steps directly tied to moving the cube using the pivot stick as intended. It misunderstood the pivotal tool manipulation required for this task. While it attempts to use some object interactions (e.g., rotating the cube), it does not achieve the goal described by the ground truth.  
    - **Correctness:** While the steps provided are logically ordered within the model's understanding, they are largely misaligned with the task goal and the sequence needed to achieve the correct outcome (e.g., the pivot manipulation is replaced with incorrect cube/holder interactions). The sequence deviates from the logical steps outlined in the human-annotated plan.  
    - **Clarity:** The model-generated instructions are clear and written in an action-object format understandable by a low-level executor. However, irrelevant or incorrect steps reduce the clarity as a whole because the task goal becomes muddled
