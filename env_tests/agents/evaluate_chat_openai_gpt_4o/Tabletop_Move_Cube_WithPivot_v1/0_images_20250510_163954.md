# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithPivot-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and push it between two cylinder on the desk
Step 2: rotate the stick till the cube on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: locate the cube
Step 2: locate the pivot
Step 3: locate the marker
Step 4: pick up the cube
Step 5: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 6: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 7: put the cube in the holder
Step 8: pull the pivot to the target area
Step 9: place the pivot with the cube on the marker
Step 10: verify the task completion
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan fails significantly in both completeness and correctness because it does not address the primary task goal of using a stick to manipulate the cube. There are unneeded steps and irrelevant actions that misdirect the task execution. However, the clarity score is high because the syntax of the individual actions aligns with the requirements of the low-level executor’s format, even if those actions are logically incorrect. Hence, the overall average score reflects poor task-specific performance but acceptable step clarity

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 40/100  
The model-generated plan includes many additional steps that are unnecessary and diverge from the task's requirements. Critical steps in the ground-truth plan, such as *picking the stick* and *rotating it to push the cube onto the marker*, are entirely missing. While there are multiple steps detailed in the model-generated plan, they do not fulfill the essential requirements of moving the cube using the stick.  

- **Correctness**: 30/100  
The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan does not logically or sequentially lead to fulfilling the task goal, as it completely deviates from the use of a stick (pivot) to manipulate the cube. Steps like "pick up the cube" and "place the pivot with the cube on the marker" behave as if the robot directly manipulates the cube, which contradicts the objective. Furthermore, some actions are irrelevant to the task goal (e.g., "rotate the cube till the blue face upward").  

- **Clarity**: 80/100  
The model-generated steps are clearly described and formatted in a way that the low-level executor can interpret and execute them. However, the validity of the description in the context of the actual task is questionable. Despite this, the low-level commands themselves are syntactically clear and actionable.  

- **Mean Score**: 50/100  

- **Justification**:  
The model-generated plan fails significantly in both completeness and correctness because it does not address the primary task goal of using a stick to manipulate the cube.
