# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Cube-WithPivot-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the stick and push it between two cylinder on the desk
Step 2: rotate the stick till the cube on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pull the pivot to the target area
Step 2: ensure the cube is aligned with the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 40/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
**  
  **Completeness:** The model-generated plan is incomplete because it omits key details from the ground-truth plan. Specifically, it does not include the step to use the stick for positioning the cube as per the ground-truth. While it specifies pulling the pivot (step 1), it doesn't account for finer manipulation like rotating the stick.  
  **Correctness:** The steps are logically reasonable but vague. The order of "pull the pivot to the target area" (step 1) and "ensure the cube is aligned with the marker" (step 2) is mostly consistent sequentially, although "ensuring alignment" is ambiguous without specifying how.  
  **Clarity:** The instructions are unclear for a low-level executor. The use of vague terms like "ensure" and "aligned with the marker" make step 2 difficult to interpret. Moreover, it lacks the simple and explicit actionable format expected by the robot executor. A clearer version might describe manipulating the cube using specific actions like "rotate the stick till the cube aligns with the marker."

Overall, the model-generated plan deviates from the ground-truth in essential details, logical granularity, and clarity, leaving room for significant improvement.
