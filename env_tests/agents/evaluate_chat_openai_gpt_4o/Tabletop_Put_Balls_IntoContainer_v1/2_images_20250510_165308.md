# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Balls-IntoContainer-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the dustpan
Step 2: squeeze all the ball in to the dustpan
Step 3: lift the dustpand
Step 4: put all balls into the container
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Put the ball into the container (dustpan).
Step 2: Repeat step 1 for each ball until all balls are in the dustpan.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 30/100
- Mean Score: 40/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits important intermediate steps such as "lift the dustpan" and "squeeze all the ball into the dustpan." It does not sufficiently cover the entire sequence required to complete this task.  
  - **Correctness**: The steps are logically flawed and out of order because placing balls directly into the container (dustpan) assumes that the dustpan is already prepared, which is missing from the preceding actions. Additionally, specifying "repeat step 1 for each ball" does not align with the expected sequential logic of bundling all balls into the dustpan first.  
  - **Clarity**: The instructions are not clear or compatible with a low-level executor—for example, "put the ball into the container (dustpan)" does not follow the action-object format expected (e.g., "pick the ball, put it into the container"). Steps are overly abstract and lack precise action-object targeting.

The model-generated plan lacks the essential steps from the ground-truth while also being misordered and unclear for effective robotic execution.
