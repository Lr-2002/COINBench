# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Balls-IntoContainer-v1 (9 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the dustpan
Step 2: squeeze all the ball in to the dustpan
Step 3: lift the dustpand
Step 4: put all balls into the container
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: put the ball into the container
Step 2: put the ball into the container
Step 3: put the ball into the container
Step 4: put the ball into the container
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 57/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits essential steps from the ground-truth plan, such as picking the dustpan, squeezing the balls into it, and lifting it before depositing the balls into the container. While it does address the ultimate task goal ("put the ball into the container"), it lacks intermediate steps that may be crucial for task execution.  
    - **Correctness**: The model-generated plan follows a logical sequence ("put the ball into the container" repeatedly), but it does not account for how the balls will be collected or prepared for placement into the container. The omission of necessary preceding actions in its order reduces its correctness.  
    - **Clarity**: The generated plan is clear and uses instructions that the low-level executor understands. The actions are described explicitly in the required format ("put the ball into the container").

The plan achieves the goal partially but is missing intermediate steps and lacks some logical depth compared to the ground-truth plan.
