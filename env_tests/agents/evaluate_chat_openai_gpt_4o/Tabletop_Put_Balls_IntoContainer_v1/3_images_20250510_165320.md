# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Balls-IntoContainer-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the dustpan
Step 2: squeeze all the ball in to the dustpan
Step 3: lift the dustpand
Step 4: put all balls into the container
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: put the ball into the container (dustpan)
Step 2: put the ball into the container (dustpan)
Step 3: put the ball into the container (dustpan)
Step 4: put the ball into the container (dustpan)
Step 5: put the ball into the container (dustpan)
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 20/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 47/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan does not include key preparatory steps found in the ground-truth plan, such as picking up the dustpan, squeezing all balls into the dustpan, and lifting the dustpan before putting the balls into the container. It directly assumes each ball can be individually placed in the container, which makes the plan incomplete.  
  - **Correctness**: Logically, the order of the model-generated steps is flawed because it does not align with the physical reality of using a dustpan for the task. The sequence implies balls are already in the dustpan without any prior steps to account for this critical subtask (e.g., squeezing balls into the dustpan). This leads to a significant logical inconsistency, reducing correctness.  
  - **Clarity**: While each step ("put the ball into the container") is written in an understandable format for execution, it lacks critical details (e.g., how the balls are gathered in the dustpan). This impacts task execution clarity for a low-level executor since the high-level strategy is not well-explained. However, the consistent format contributes to a better score for clarity
