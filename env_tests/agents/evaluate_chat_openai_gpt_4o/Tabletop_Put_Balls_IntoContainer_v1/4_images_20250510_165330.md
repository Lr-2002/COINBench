# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Balls-IntoContainer-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the dustpan
Step 2: squeeze all the ball in to the dustpan
Step 3: lift the dustpand
Step 4: put all balls into the container
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: put the ball into the container
Step 2: put the ball into the container
Step 3: put the ball into the container
Step 4: put the ball into the container
Step 5: put the ball into the container
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 63/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan covers only a narrow subset of the task goal, omitting critical preparatory steps for success. While the steps themselves are executable and well-described, the plan assumes a simplistic scenario and offers redundant steps without adapting to the full task context. This lowers both completeness and correctness, although clarity remains reasonably high for the isolated steps described

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 50/100**  
  The model-generated plan does not include essential preparation steps, such as picking up a dustpan or gathering all the balls in a coordinated way. It assumes individual balls can immediately be transferred to the container, which may not work in practice if balls are scattered.

- **Correctness: 60/100**  
  The steps are logically sequential within the narrow scope of "put each ball into the container." However, the order skips actions required earlier in the task (e.g., gathering balls into the dustpan), which are essential for a complete solution. The plan seems incomplete when viewed in the context of the full goal.

- **Clarity: 80/100**  
  Each step is written in a clear, low-level executor-compatible form ("put the ball into the container"), but the redundancy across all the steps (repeating the same action) reduces overall clarity of how to accomplish the intended purpose.

- **Mean Score: 63.33/100**

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan covers only a narrow subset of the task goal, omitting critical preparatory steps for success. While the steps themselves are executable and well-described, the plan assumes a simplistic scenario and offers redundant steps without adapting to the full task context.
