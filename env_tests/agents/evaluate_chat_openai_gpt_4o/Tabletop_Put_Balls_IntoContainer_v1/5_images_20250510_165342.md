# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Balls-IntoContainer-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the dustpan
Step 2: squeeze all the ball in to the dustpan
Step 3: lift the dustpand
Step 4: put all balls into the container
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: put the ball into the container (dustpan)
Step 2: move to the next ball
Step 3: put the ball into the container (dustpan)
Step 4: move to the next ball
Step 5: put the ball into the container (dustpan)
Step 6: move to the next ball
Step 7: put the ball into the container (dustpan)
Step 8: repeat until all balls are in the dustpan
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
1. **Completeness (70/100)**:  
   The model-generated plan does describe a repetitive process of placing balls into the dustpan until they are all accounted for. However, it omits critical high-level steps needed to achieve the task goal, such as picking up the dustpan at the start and transferring the balls from the dustpan into the container at the end. These steps are essential to achieving the stated goal and are present in the ground-truth plan.

### Justification:

These steps are essential to achieving the stated goal and are present in the ground-truth plan.

2. **Correctness (60/100)**:  
   While the model's plan includes repetitive actions to collect balls, the sequence is inefficient and logically incomplete because the dustpan is not initially picked up, nor is it used effectively in conjunction with placing the balls into the final container. Furthermore, repeating "move to the next ball" and "put the ball into the container (dustpan)" without clearly terminating the process upon completion lacks proper instruction sequencing. 

3. **Clarity (50/100)**:  
   The instructions provided in the model's plan lack the prescribed low-level syntax for commands and are not clearly segmented for a basic executor. For example, phrases like "repeat until all balls are in the dustpan" rely on higher-level interpretive logic rather than step-by-step instruction (e.g., "pick up the ball and put it in the dustpan"). The omission of the dustpan's initial or final interactions also reduces overall clarity. 

Overall, the model-generated plan lacks critical steps, contains logical sequencing issues, and deviates from the understandable format for a low-level executor, leading to a lower mean score.
