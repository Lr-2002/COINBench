# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Balls-IntoContainer-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the dustpan
Step 2: squeeze all the ball in to the dustpan
Step 3: lift the dustpand
Step 4: put all balls into the container
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: put the ball into the container (dustpan) for the green ball
Step 2: put the ball into the container (dustpan) for the pink ball
Step 3: put the ball into the container (dustpan) for the white ball
Step 4: put the ball into the container (dustpan) for the blue ball
Step 5: put the ball into the container (dustpan) for the purple ball
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 75/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 73/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan is partially complete but omits critical steps involving the dustpan as an intermediary tool, reducing completeness. Logically, it operates inefficiently by tackling balls one at a time and neglects the integral dustpan lifting and transfer step, hurting correctness. However, the language of the actions is adequately clear and understandable for a low-level executor, resulting in a high clarity score. The overall mean score reflects the combination of these considerations

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 75/100**  
  The model-generated plan includes actions to sequentially handle each ball individually, which can achieve the task goal eventually. However, it does not reference the dustpan (required in the ground-truth plan) for collecting and transferring the balls, leaving out critical steps like explicitly lifting the dustpan or putting all balls into a final container after collection. This partial omission lowers the score for completeness.

- **Correctness: 60/100**  
  While the individual actions in the model-generated plan appear logical and correctly ordered, the plan's overall logic is inefficient and misaligned with the ground-truth approach. Additionally, the model generates repetitive steps (dealing with balls individually) without leveraging the dustpan. It fails to incorporate a key sequential step — transferring them via a combined mechanism (dustpan) to the container — reducing the correctness score.

- **Clarity: 85/100**  
  The steps in the model-generated plan are written clearly and use simple action-object phrasing understandable for a low-level executor. Nevertheless, the plan does not clarify the notion of intermediate use of "dustpan as a container," which could confuse the executor without additional context, slightly reducing the clarity.

- **Mean Score: 73/100**  
  \( (75 + 60 + 85) / 3 = 73.33 \), rounded to 73.
