# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Put-Balls-IntoContainer-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the dustpan
Step 2: squeeze all the ball in to the dustpan
Step 3: lift the dustpand
Step 4: put all balls into the container
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Locate the balls and the dustpan in the scene.
Step 2: Put the ball into the container (dustpan) for each ball found.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits key steps such as picking up the dustpan, squeezing all the balls into the dustpan, and lifting the dustpan before depositing balls into the container. These actions are essential for the successful execution of the task as described in the ground-truth plan.  
  - **Correctness**: The sequence is logically flawed because the model-generated plan does not establish the preliminary actions required (e.g., obtaining and using the dustpan to gather the balls). The sequential flow does not align with the ground-truth plan's logical progression of subtasks.  
  - **Clarity**: While the steps are described clearly enough for a low-level executor to understand, they lack proper detail and precise instruction. The phrase "Locate the balls and the dustpan in the scene" is relatively high-level and more suited for perception, not actionable commands. However, "Put the ball into the container (dustpan) for each ball found" is sufficiently low-level for execution.

The model-generated plan needs refinement to ensure it aligns logically and comprehensively with the ground-truth plan and provides complete instructions for the task execution.
