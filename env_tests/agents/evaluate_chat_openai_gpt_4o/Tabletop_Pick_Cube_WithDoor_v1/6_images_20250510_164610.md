# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithDoor-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: No action required.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 0/100
- Correctness: 0/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 17/100

## Justification
- *Completeness*: The model-generated plan fails to include any action necessary to accomplish the task goal. The ground-truth includes steps to open the door and push the cube to the marker, which are entirely missing in the generated plan.  
  - *Correctness*: The single step provided by the model ("No action required") is logically incorrect because actions are clearly required to meet the task goal.  
  - *Clarity*: While the single step "No action required" is clearly stated, it is overly vague and provides no clear instruction for the low-level executor, which diminishes its utility in context
