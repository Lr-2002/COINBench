# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithDoor-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 3: place the cube on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan misses a critical step from the ground-truth plan—opening the door. Without opening the door, the robot might not even access the cube. While the model includes extra steps that are action-related (manipulating the cube), they don't prioritize the essential step outlined in the ground-truth plan. Essential task steps are missing, which significantly lowers the rating.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence logically flows, assuming the door is already open. However, because the prerequisite action of opening the door is missing, the logical flow from "pick up the cube" to subsequent steps is invalid unless the environment has changed substantially since the model's generation. This results in a low score for correctness.  
  - **Clarity:** The model-generated plan describes steps in an understandable way for a low-level executor, following the required format (e.g., "pick up the cube, put it in the holder"). The clarity is sufficiently high, earning a good score in this criterion
