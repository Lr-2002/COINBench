# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithDoor-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: locate the cube
Step 2: locate the marker
Step 3: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 4: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 5: pick up the cube, put it to the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan includes additional steps not specified in the ground-truth plan but fails to address the essential step of opening the door (as the task description includes "WithDoor," which likely involves door manipulation). This key omission significantly impacts the plan's completeness, resulting in a lower score.  
  - **Correctness:** Some steps are logical but seem unnecessary for the given task (e.g., "rotate the cube till the blue face upward"). The sequence partially aligns with the goal but includes redundant or out-of-order operations. The incorrect prioritization of opening the door also impacts the logical order.  
  - **Clarity:** The model-generated plan uses clear low-level executor instructions that are consistent with the allowed action primitives, but excessive details make the plan overly verbose and less direct compared to the ground truth. Instructions like "locate the cube" could be implicit or unnecessary given the task simplicity
