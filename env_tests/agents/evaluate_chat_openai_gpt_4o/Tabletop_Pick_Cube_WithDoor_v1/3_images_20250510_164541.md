# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithDoor-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube
Step 2: put the cube in the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 63/100

## Justification
**  
While the steps provided by the model are clearly described and logically ordered for handling the cube, the omission of the crucial "open the door" step makes the plan incomplete. A subtask dependency (opening the door) is assumed but not explicitly addressed. Consequently, this impacts both the completeness and correctness scores significantly, whereas clarity remains high

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 50/100**  
The model-generated plan omits opening the door, which is necessary to access the cube in this scenario. While it includes actions related to handling the cube (picking and placing), it assumes the door is already open, which violates the requirement to include all essential steps.

- **Correctness: 50/100**  
The logical sequence of "pick up the cube" and "put the cube in the marker" is correct. However, the plan fails to account for the initial condition of the door being closed. Without first opening the door, the robot would not be able to pick up the cube, breaking the logical task flow.

- **Clarity: 90/100**  
The model-generated steps are described in a manner that is clear and understandable for a low-level executor. The instructions align with the accepted action-object format. However, missing the action to "open the door" slightly reduces clarity in the broader task context.

- **Mean Score: 63.33/100**

- **Justification:**  
While the steps provided by the model are clearly described and logically ordered for handling the cube, the omission of the crucial "open the door" step makes the plan incomplete. A subtask dependency (opening the door) is assumed but not explicitly addressed. Consequently, this impacts both the completeness and correctness scores significantly, whereas clarity remains high.
