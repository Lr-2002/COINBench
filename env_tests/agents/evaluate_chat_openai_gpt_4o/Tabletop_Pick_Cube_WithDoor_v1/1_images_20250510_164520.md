# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithDoor-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube
Step 2: put the cube in the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 63/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan lacks completeness because it skips an essential step (`open the door`). While the steps provided are sequentially logical, they are invalid due to dependence on a missing prerequisite action (opening the door). The clarity is strong, as the plan uses precise instructions that are easy to follow for the low-level executor. However, the overall score is significantly reduced due to the omission of critical elements

## Raw GPT Response
```
### Evaluation

- **Completeness:** 50/100  
The model-generated plan fails to include the essential step of opening the door. Without this step, the robot cannot access the cube, rendering the plan incomplete for the given task goal.

- **Correctness:** 60/100  
The steps provided in the model-generated plan (`pick up the cube` and `put the cube in the marker`) are technically logical actions if the cube were accessible. However, the sequence is incorrect as it assumes the cube is already accessible, disregarding the necessity of opening the door first.

- **Clarity:** 80/100  
The model-generated plan is clear and uses simple, well-structured instructions that the low-level executor can easily understand. However, its clarity does not compensate for the omission of essential steps.

- **Mean Score:** 63.33/100  

- **Justification:**  
The model-generated plan lacks completeness because it skips an essential step (`open the door`). While the steps provided are sequentially logical, they are invalid due to dependence on a missing prerequisite action (opening the door). The clarity is strong, as the plan uses precise instructions that are easy to follow for the low-level executor. However, the overall score is significantly reduced due to the omission of critical elements.
