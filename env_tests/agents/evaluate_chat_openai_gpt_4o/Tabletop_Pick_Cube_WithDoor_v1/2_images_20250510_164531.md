# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithDoor-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pick up the cube
Step 3: put the cube to the marker
Step 4: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 90/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan completes the goal task while adding additional actions for better closure (e.g., closing the door afterward). However, it introduces assumptions that slightly deviate from the minimal requirements of the ground-truth plan ("pick up the cube," breaking "push" into two steps). Logically, the execution order is correct, but it may add complexity if the provided context does not align. Clarity is excellent, with clear, executable instructions for the robot

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 90/100**  
  The model-generated plan includes additional steps beyond the goal task, such as closing the cabinet door after the manipulation is done. However, it also uses distinct steps for "pick up the cube" and "put the cube to the marker," which are implied but not explicitly broken down in the human-annotated plan. While these steps are useful and more robust, some redundancy is present, such as "open the cabinet door," suggesting it may have assumed additional context not specified in the goal.  

- **Correctness: 85/100**  
  The steps provided are sequentially logical. "Open the cabinet door" is assumed to mean opening an enclosure containing the cube. However, "push the cube to the marker" in the ground-truth plan implies sliding or moving it directly across the surface. The model-generated plan assumes the cube needs to be picked up, possibly introducing unnecessary complexity depending on the actual context.  

- **Clarity: 95/100**  
  The instructions are very clear and formatted appropriately for the low-level executor. Each step adheres to the structure "<action> the <object>," making the generated plan understandable and executable.  

- **Mean Score: 90/100**
