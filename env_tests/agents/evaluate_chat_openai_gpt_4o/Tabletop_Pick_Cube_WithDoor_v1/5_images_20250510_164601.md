# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Cube-WithDoor-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
Step 2: push the cube to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 3: rotate the cube till the blue face upward
Step 4: pick up the cube, put it on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan doesn't include the essential step to "open the door", which is explicitly required to achieve the task goal and specified in the ground-truth plan. The omission of this critical step significantly reduces its completeness score.

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 50/100  
- **Correctness**: 60/100  
- **Clarity**: 70/100  
- **Mean Score**: 60/100  
- **Justification**:  

  - **Completeness**: The model-generated plan doesn't include the essential step to "open the door", which is explicitly required to achieve the task goal and specified in the ground-truth plan. The omission of this critical step significantly reduces its completeness score.  

  - **Correctness**: The model-generated plan describes logically ordered steps but diverges from the simpler ground-truth plan. It adds unnecessary actions such as rotating the holder and cube. While the sequence itself is logical, it introduces redundant actions that don't align closely with the straightforward solution in the ground-truth plan.  

  - **Clarity**: The individual instructions in the model-generated plan are clear and formatted in a way that is understandable for the low-level executor. However, because it introduces irrelevant actions (e.g., "put cube in holder"), there is potential confusion as to why these steps are necessary for accomplishing the task goal. This results in a moderate clarity score.
