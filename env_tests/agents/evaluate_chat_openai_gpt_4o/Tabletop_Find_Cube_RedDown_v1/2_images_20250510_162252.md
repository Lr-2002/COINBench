# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Cube-RedDown-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: see all the face of farest cube 
Step 2: see all the face of left cube 
Step 3: see all the face of nearst cube 
Step 4: find the cube have no red face over the ground and put it to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube with the red face downward
Step 2: rotate the cube till the red face upward
Step 3: put the cube on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan skips critical perception steps described in the ground-truth plan. Specifically, identifying and inspecting multiple cubes to find the correct one is essential but omitted. Thus, it fails to include all necessary steps.  
  - **Correctness:** While the sequence of actions in the model-generated plan logically leads to putting a cube on the marker, it makes a critical error by directly starting with "pick up the cube with the red face downward." This assumes that the correct cube has already been identified, which contradicts the nature of the task.  
  - **Clarity:** The model-generated instructions use a format understandable by the low-level executor (e.g., "rotate the cube till the red face upward"), and actions like "put the cube on the marker" are clear. However, the omission of perception steps makes it ambiguous to lower-level execution if the cube is the correct one
