# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Cube-RedDown-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: see all the face of farest cube 
Step 2: see all the face of left cube 
Step 3: see all the face of nearst cube 
Step 4: find the cube have no red face over the ground and put it to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the cube till the red face upward
Step 3: pick up the cube and put it on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
1. **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits critical initial steps necessary to locate and identify the relevant cube by its color (red down), as stated in the task goal and represented in the ground-truth plan. It assumes that the correct cube has already been identified without including the visual verification process. This lack of essential identification steps reduces its completeness score significantly.  
  2. **Correctness**: While the procedural logic of rotating the cube and placing it on the marker appears sequentially reasonable, the task of identifying and verifying the target cube is ignored, making the plan less logically sound. Additionally, the generation step "rotate the cube till the red face upward" conflicts with the task goal of having the **red face down**. This error in directionality drastically impacts the correctness of the steps.  
  3. **Clarity**: The steps are overall clearly framed and mostly compatible with the expected low-level executor's instruction format. However, the description "rotate the cube till the red face upward" introduces confusion as it contradicts the task's requirements. Given the importance of precise communication for low-level execution, this error lowers the clarity score
