# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Cube-RedDown-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: see all the face of farest cube 
Step 2: see all the face of left cube 
Step 3: see all the face of nearst cube 
Step 4: find the cube have no red face over the ground and put it to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: rotate the cube till the red face upward
Step 3: pick up the cube and put it on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
**  
  **Completeness:** The model-generated plan lacks the initial exploration and identification steps necessary to locate the target cube mentioned in the ground-truth plan. Specifically, it omits systematically seeing the faces of the cubes to determine which cube has no red face over the ground. This step is essential for achieving the stated task goal, resulting in an incomplete plan. However, it does contain subsequent manipulation actions relevant to handling a cube, so it is partially complete.

- **Justification:**  
  **Completeness:** The model-generated plan lacks the initial exploration and identification steps necessary to locate the target cube mentioned in the ground-truth plan. Specifically, it omits systematically seeing the faces of the cubes to determine which cube has no red face over the ground. This step is essential for achieving the stated task goal, resulting in an incomplete plan. However, it does contain subsequent manipulation actions relevant to handling a cube, so it is partially complete.  

  **Correctness:** The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan is questionable. Step 1, "pick up the cube, put it in the holder," is logically incoherent when no information is provided about how the correct cube was identified in advance. Additionally, rotating the cube and then putting it on the marker (Step 2 and Step 3) contradict the ground-truth goal of ensuring "no red face" is over the groundâ€”you don't need to "rotate the red face upward" as per the given task goal. The plan is partially correct in addressing cube manipulation but fails to align logically with the problem's requirements.  

  **Clarity:** The model-generated instructions are fairly clear and actionable for the low-level executor (the language closely matches its expected vocabulary). Each step is explicit and follows the right format. However, the instructions don't provide enough context for determining how the correct cube to manipulate was identified, making the description less useful for the overall task scenario. Thus, clarity is good but not perfect.
