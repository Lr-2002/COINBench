# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Cube-RedDown-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: see all the face of farest cube 
Step 2: see all the face of left cube 
Step 3: see all the face of nearst cube 
Step 4: find the cube have no red face over the ground and put it to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: search for the cube in the visible area
Step 2: open the drawer if the cube is not visible
Step 3: open the cabinet door if the cube is not found in the drawer
Step 4: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 5: rotate the cube till the red face upward
Step 6: put the cube on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes several reasonable steps to locate and manipulate a cube, but it diverges from the ground-truth plan in critical ways. Specifically, it assumes a broader search strategy (e.g., opening a drawer or cabinet), which is not explicitly required in the ground-truth and may not align with the environment. Additionally, it does not include the essential step of checking the faces of all cubes to find the one with no red face over the ground before putting it to the marker.  
    - **Correctness**: The model-generated plan has logical inconsistencies compared to the task goal. For example, it instructs the robot to pick up and place the cube indiscriminately on the holder and then the marker without guaranteeing it has identified the correct cube (i.e., the one with "no red face over the ground"). The step sequence for locating and determining the correct cube logically diverges from the ground truth's environment-specific actions.  
    - **Clarity**: The instructions are generally clear and low-level, adhering to the format expected by the executor. However, some steps (e.g., "rotate the cube till the red face upward") do not align with the task goal of finding a cube with no red face over the ground, introducing potential confusion for the executor. This mismatch impacts overall clarity for the specific task goal
