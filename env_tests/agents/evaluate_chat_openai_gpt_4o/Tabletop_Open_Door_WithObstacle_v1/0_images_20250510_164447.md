# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Open-Door-WithObstacle-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the blue board
Step 2: open the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 100/100
- Mean Score: 73/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan is straightforward and clear for execution, but it misses a critical step, making it incomplete and partially correct. The task cannot be wholly accomplished without addressing the obstacle (blue board) first. Hence, the scores reflect high clarity but penalties in completeness and correctness

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 50/100**  
The model-generated plan skips an essential step ("move the blue board") that is critical for achieving the task. This renders the plan incomplete compared to the ground-truth plan. Although it includes "open the door," it lacks prior steps necessary to handle potential obstacles.

- **Correctness: 70/100**  
While the step "open the door" is logically correct and follows the proper sequence for opening the door, it omits another essential prior step ("move the blue board"). Therefore, the order is inherently flawed due to the omission.

- **Clarity: 100/100**  
The single action provided in the model-generated plan ("open the door") is described clearly in a format understandable by the low-level executor.

- **Mean Score: 73.33/100**

- **Justification:**  
The model-generated plan is straightforward and clear for execution, but it misses a critical step, making it incomplete and partially correct. The task cannot be wholly accomplished without addressing the obstacle (blue board) first. Hence, the scores reflect high clarity but penalties in completeness and correctness.
