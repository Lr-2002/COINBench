# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Open-Door-WithObstacle-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the blue board
Step 2: open the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 73/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan misses an essential step: "move the blue board." Without completing this step, the robot may not be able to fully or safely open the door, depending on the specific task environment. This omission significantly impacts the completeness score.  
  - **Correctness:** While the single action "open the door" is logically and sequentially correct, it assumes that no obstacle exists. The failure to account for the board makes it contextually incomplete, though the step itself is valid.  
  - **Clarity:** The action "open the door" is clear and formatted appropriately for the low-level executor. It is precise and directly actionable, so clarity is high
