# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Open-Door-WithObstacle-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the blue board
Step 2: open the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 100/100
- Clarity: 100/100
- Mean Score: 83/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan omits an essential step ("move the blue board") which is necessary to clear the obstacle before opening the door. This omission impacts the feasibility of completing the task goal.  
  - **Correctness:** The single step provided in the model-generated plan ("open the door") is logically and sequentially correct as a standalone action and aligns with the task's objective. However, it assumes preconditions (i.e., obstacle removal) are already met.  
  - **Clarity:** The step is clearly and unambiguously described following the low-level executor format. There is no confusion in understanding the instruction
