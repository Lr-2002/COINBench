# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Keep-Pivot-Balance-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put the left cube on the pivot
Step 2: put the right cube on the pivot
Step 3: move them to make the pivot balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: stack all the cube
Step 2: adjust the cubes on the board to maintain balance
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 30/100
- Mean Score: 40/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan neglects the clear specification of actions involving left and right cubes as stated in the ground-truth plan. The task goal assumes interacting directly and explicitly with the pivot, which is absent in the model-generated plan. While the intent of achieving balance is partially addressed, essential steps, like placing individual cubes on the pivot, are missing.  
  - **Correctness**: The model proposes a sequence that diverges from the logical procedure of balancing the pivot. "Stack all the cube" is not an appropriate first step, as it contradicts the need to handle cubes individually on the pivot. Adjusting balance after stacking cubes is unclear and lacks the necessary low-level operability for achieving the pivot balance. The proposed order deviates substantially from the step-by-step constraints.  
  - **Clarity**: The actions in the model-generated plan are vague and ambiguous, lacking low-level operable instructions for the executor (e.g., it does not specify clearly "put the left cube on the pivot," "put the right cube on the pivot," or "adjust the pivot"). Terms like "adjust the cubes on the board to maintain balance" are insufficiently clear for execution by a robotic system, as they fail to describe concrete low-level actions tied to the pivot mechanism
