# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Keep-Pivot-Balance-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put the left cube on the pivot
Step 2: put the right cube on the pivot
Step 3: move them to make the pivot balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: stack all the cube
Step 2: adjust the position of the cubes on the board to maintain balance
Step 3: ensure the board remains balanced on the triangular prism
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
**Completeness**: The model plan fails to explicitly include the essential step of placing the individual cubes onto the pivot, which is crucial for the task. While it involves "adjusting" the cubes for balance, it skips essential parts of the task outlined in the ground truth plan.

- **Justification**:  
  **Completeness**: The model plan fails to explicitly include the essential step of placing the individual cubes onto the pivot, which is crucial for the task. While it involves "adjusting" the cubes for balance, it skips essential parts of the task outlined in the ground truth plan.  

  **Correctness**: The logical sequence of actions in the model plan is flawed, as it starts by stacking all cubes rather than explicitly placing them one by one onto the pivot. This is incongruent with the goal of balancing a specific pivot and may introduce unintentional ambiguity in maintaining balance.  

  **Clarity**: The model plan is less clear and diverges from the action primitives the low-level executor understands. For example, "stack all the cube" and "adjust the position" are too vague compared to clear directives like "put the left cube on the pivot." The generated plan does not use the action format required for execution in this environment.
