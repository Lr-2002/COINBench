# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Keep-Pivot-Balance-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put the left cube on the pivot
Step 2: put the right cube on the pivot
Step 3: move them to make the pivot balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Adjust the position of the long board to fully balance it on the triangular prism.
Step 2: Pick up the first cube and place it on one side of the board to maintain balance.
Step 3: Pick up the second cube and place it on the opposite side of the board to maintain balance.
Step 4: Repeat the process with additional cubes if necessary to ensure the board remains balanced.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
**
  - The model-generated plan does touch on balancing objects, which aligns partially with the task goal, but departs significantly from the ground-truth plan in terms of the specific sequence and description of actions. The introduction of an unnecessary "long board" concept, coupled with vague instructions, reduces the plan's clarity, completeness, and correctness relative to the task's actual requirements.

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 70/100**
  - The model-generated plan includes some important essential steps (placing cubes on the pivot and achieving balance) but misses the specific initial action of placing the cubes directly on the pivot (as seen in the human-issued steps). Instead, it vaguely implies balancing with cubes on a "board," which introduces ambiguity in the match to the task goal.

- **Correctness: 60/100**
  - While the model-generated plan follows a logical order, the actions deviate from the ground-truth plan. It modifies the process by introducing a "long board" (not specified in the ground-truth plan or task goal). Furthermore, the recursive instruction to "repeat the process" adds ambiguity, and it doesn't clearly match the specified work on a "pivot," which disrupts the logical sequence for the task.

- **Clarity: 50/100**
  - The language and structure of the model-generated plan are somewhat clear but not well-suited for the low-level executor. For instance, instructions like "adjust the position of the long board" and "repeat the process" are too high-level and vague. The lack of specific low-level commands (e.g., "put the left cube on the pivot") makes it less understandable for the executor.

- **Mean Score: 60/100**

- **Justification:**
  - The model-generated plan does touch on balancing objects, which aligns partially with the task goal, but departs significantly from the ground-truth plan in terms of the specific sequence and description of actions. The introduction of an unnecessary "long board" concept, coupled with vague instructions, reduces the plan's clarity, completeness, and correctness relative to the task's actual requirements. 

Overall, the model-generated plan requires refinement to align closely with the low-level executor's needs and the original ground-truth steps.
