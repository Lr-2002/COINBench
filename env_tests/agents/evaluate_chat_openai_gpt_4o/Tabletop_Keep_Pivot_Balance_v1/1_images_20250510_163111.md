# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Keep-Pivot-Balance-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put the left cube on the pivot
Step 2: put the right cube on the pivot
Step 3: move them to make the pivot balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 2: stack all the cube
Step 3: adjust the position of the cubes to balance the board on the triangular prism
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
**
The model-generated plan captures the general objective of balancing but includes extraneous steps (e.g., holder interaction that doesn't align logically with the pivot task). It lacks clear, low-level language compatibility and fails to fully represent the explicit task goal

### Evaluation of the Model-Generated Plan:

#### **Completeness: 70/100**
The ground-truth plan has explicit instructions to place the cubes on the pivot and move them to achieve balance. The model-generated plan covers picking up cubes, stacking them, and balancing them, but lacks explicit clarification about the pivot being the central focus for placing cubes. The adjustment description is slightly vague.

#### **Correctness: 60/100**
While the general idea of stacking and balancing is present, the model-generated plan introduces holder interaction ("pick up the cube, put it in the holder") which deviates from the task requirements to directly place cubes on the pivot. Furthermore, it assumes stacking all cubes without confirming whether stacking is necessary for balancing the pivot specifically.

#### **Clarity: 50/100**
The model-generated plan lacks precision in describing each step in task-specific, low-level executor-compatible language. For example, "adjust the position of the cubes to balance the board on the triangular prism" is ambiguous compared to a clear instruction such as "move the cubes to make the pivot balance." Moreover, "put it in the holder" does not align directly with the tabletop pivot tasks.

#### **Mean Score: 60/100**

#### **Justification:**
The model-generated plan captures the general objective of balancing but includes extraneous steps (e.g., holder interaction that doesn't align logically with the pivot task). It lacks clear, low-level language compatibility and fails to fully represent the explicit task goal.
