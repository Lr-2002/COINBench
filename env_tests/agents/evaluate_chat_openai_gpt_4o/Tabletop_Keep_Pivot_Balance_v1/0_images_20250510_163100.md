# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Keep-Pivot-Balance-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put the left cube on the pivot
Step 2: put the right cube on the pivot
Step 3: move them to make the pivot balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Locate the long board and the triangular prism in the scene.
Step 2: Pick up the long board and place it on the triangular prism to balance it.
Step 3: Locate the cubes in the scene.
Step 4: Pick up the cubes one by one and place them strategically on the board to maintain balance.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 30/100
- Mean Score: 40/100

## Justification
1. **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes additional steps (e.g., locating the long board and triangular prism) and does not correspond well to the ground-truth problem description, which involves working directly with cubes and a pivot. The true essential steps of "put the left cube on the pivot" and "put the right cube on the pivot" are not explicitly and accurately included. Additionally, handling and balancing the pivot are vague compared to the ground-truth steps.  
  2. **Correctness**: The sequencing of steps in the model-generated plan is not compatible with the ground truth. There is an incorrect assumption that a long board and triangular prism are part of the task. This distracts from the correct operation of balancing using the cubes directly on the pivot. Thus, the steps are neither logically nor sequentially correct for this task.  
  3. **Clarity**: The instructions are verbose and lack precise commands for the low-level executor. For example, instead of "place them strategically on the board to maintain balance," a clear and actionable command in the format of `<action> the <object>` is needed, such as "put the left cube on the pivot." The plan is also confusing due to the introduction of unnecessary objects (long board/triangular prism), making it hard for an executor to understand and implement
