# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Keep-Pivot-Balance-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: put the left cube on the pivot
Step 2: put the right cube on the pivot
Step 3: move them to make the pivot balance
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: stack all the cube
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 30/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 20/100
- Mean Score: 30/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan fails to explicitly include the primary steps of placing the left cube and the right cube on the pivot separately, as well as the crucial step of ensuring the pivot is balanced. It collapses these essential steps into the vague instruction "stack all the cube," which is far from complete for the given task.  
  - **Correctness**: "Stack all the cube" does not sequentially or logically align with the explicit task of balancing the pivot by placing cubes thoughtfully. The described action suggests stacking all cubes together, which may not achieve the goal of balancing a pivot.  
  - **Clarity**: The instruction lacks clarity. It does not describe explicitly which objects are involved or where/how they are to be placed, making it unsuitable for a low-level executor that requires granular instructions like "put the left cube on the pivot."

The model-generated plan is overly high-level, underspecified, and lacks fidelity to the detailed steps required for both task completion and successful execution by a low-level robotic system.
