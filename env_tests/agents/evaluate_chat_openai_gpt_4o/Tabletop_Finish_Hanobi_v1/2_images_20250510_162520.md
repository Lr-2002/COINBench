# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Finish-Hanobi-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the red one to the right
Step 2: move the yellow one to the right
Step 3: move the blue one to the top of right
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Remove the top ring from the peg.
Step 2: Place the removed ring onto the table temporarily.
Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all rings are removed from the peg.
Step 4: Pick up the largest ring and place it on the peg.
Step 5: Pick up the second largest ring and place it on top of the largest ring on the peg.
Step 6: Pick up the third largest ring and place it on top of the second largest ring on the peg.
Step 7: Continue this process until all rings are stacked in descending size order on the peg.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 75/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 68/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan is functionally aligned with the task goal and describes a passable approach, but lacks the specificity, direct alignment, and clarity of atomic instructions (e.g., "move red to right," "stack X on Y") seen in the human-annotated ground truth. Steps are somewhat overcomplicated and not specified with the clarity expected for low-level execution

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 70/100**  
  The model-generated plan does provide a detailed description for most of the task (i.e., disassembling and reassembling the stack in the correct order). However, there is redundancy in its approach compared to the ground truth, which is more compact. Additionally, it doesn't map exactly to "move the red/yellow/blue one to the right" as specified in the ground-truth plan, so step-to-goal alignment appears partial rather than fully replicating the intended task structure.

- **Correctness: 75/100**  
  The logical sequence of steps in the plan is mostly correct for completing the overall goal in principle (unspecified subtasks like removing rings are valid approaches). However, it is less direct than the reference ground truth. Certain phrases like "temporarily place on the table" introduce ambiguities about the intermediate constraints, which could possibly impact optimal performance (e.g., no reference to specific rings like "blue/yellow/red").

- **Clarity: 60/100**  
  While the steps are articulated in natural language, they lack the level of atomic, precise instructions required for execution by a low-level executor. For instance, there is no use of strict, constrained language like "move X to Y." Actions such as "remove the top ring" or "place it temporarily" are ambiguous without exact targets or secondary contexts.

- **Mean Score: 68.33/100**
