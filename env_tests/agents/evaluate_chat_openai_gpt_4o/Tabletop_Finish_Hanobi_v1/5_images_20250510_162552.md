# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Finish-Hanobi-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the red one to the right
Step 2: move the yellow one to the right
Step 3: move the blue one to the top of right
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the yellow hanobi ring
Step 2: put the yellow hanobi ring on the marker
Step 3: pick up the red hanobi ring
Step 4: put the red hanobi ring on the marker
Step 5: pick up the blue hanobi ring
Step 6: put the blue hanobi ring on the marker
Step 7: stack all the hanobi rings in big to small order
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 80/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 80/100

## Justification
- **Completeness** received a high score because it ultimately achieves the goal, but scores were deducted for additional redundant steps compared to the ground-truth plan.
- **Correctness** scores lower due to logical inefficiencies and deviations from optimal execution order, which can lead to confusion or suboptimal execution. 
- **Clarity** is strong as instructions are explicit and executable, but not perfect due to redundancy in the workflow

## Raw GPT Response

### Evaluation:

#### Completeness: 80/100  
While the model-generated plan includes steps that could logically complete the task goal (stacking the rings in the correct order), it deviates from the ground-truth plan. The sequence suggests some redundant interactions (e.g., placing rings on the marker instead of directly stacking them), but still indirectly achieves the final expected stacked configuration.

#### Correctness: 70/100  
The model-generated plan demonstrates some logical issuesâ€”placing rings on the marker before stacking them risks breaking the exact order or introducing unnecessary complexity. Additionally, the order in which the rings are manipulated (yellow, red, blue) contradicts the ideal top-down stacking sequence described in the ground truth. While the stacking action at the end resolves the goal, the intermediate steps may lead to inefficiencies or errors in execution.

#### Clarity: 90/100  
Instructions are clearly described and can be understood by the low-level executor, with specific references like "pick up" and "put on the marker." However, clarity is slightly reduced due to the redundancy of putting rings on a marker before stacking, which could confuse the executor about the task's prioritization.

#### Mean Score: 80/100  

#### Justification:  
- **Completeness** received a high score because it ultimately achieves the goal, but scores were deducted for additional redundant steps compared to the ground-truth plan.
- **Correctness** scores lower due to logical inefficiencies and deviations from optimal execution order, which can lead to confusion or suboptimal execution. 
- **Clarity** is strong as instructions are explicit and executable, but not perfect due to redundancy in the workflow.
