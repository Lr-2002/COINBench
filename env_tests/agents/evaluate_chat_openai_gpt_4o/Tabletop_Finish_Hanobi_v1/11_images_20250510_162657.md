# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Finish-Hanobi-v1 (11 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the red one to the right
Step 2: move the yellow one to the right
Step 3: move the blue one to the top of right
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Pick up the blue ring from the current pole.
Step 2: Place the blue ring on the target pole.
Step 3: Pick up the yellow ring from the current pole.
Step 4: Place the yellow ring on the target pole above the blue ring.
Step 5: Pick up the red ring from the current pole.
Step 6: Place the red ring on the target pole above the yellow ring.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 100/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 100/100
- Mean Score: 97/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan was complete, logically correct, and clearly described in a way that matches the low-level executor's expectations. While the ground truth plan is more concise, the model-generated plan provides additional clarity and explicit instructions that benefit the executor's understanding without sacrificing the correctness or completeness of the task. The slight deviation in simplicity accounts for the minor deduction in correctness

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 100/100**  
The model-generated plan includes all essential steps required to achieve the task goal. Each ring (blue, yellow, red) is correctly addressed in the manipulation process with details for picking up and placing them sequentially on the target pole.

- **Correctness: 90/100**  
The steps are logically correct and properly ordered for achieving the desired goal. However, while it aligns well with the overall outcome, the level of detail introduced slightly deviates from the simpler ground-truth plan, which might introduce minor inefficiencies. Nevertheless, the sequence adheres to the rules of the Hanabi task.

- **Clarity: 100/100**  
The instructions are described in a format that is clear and understandable for the low-level executor. Each step follows the prescribed "<action> the <object>" structure appropriately, ensuring the task can be executed without confusion.

- **Mean Score: 97/100**  

- **Justification:**  
The model-generated plan was complete, logically correct, and clearly described in a way that matches the low-level executor's expectations. While the ground truth plan is more concise, the model-generated plan provides additional clarity and explicit instructions that benefit the executor's understanding without sacrificing the correctness or completeness of the task.
