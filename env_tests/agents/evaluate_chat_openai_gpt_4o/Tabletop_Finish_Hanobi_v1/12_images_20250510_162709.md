# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Finish-Hanobi-v1 (12 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the red one to the right
Step 2: move the yellow one to the right
Step 3: move the blue one to the top of right
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the blue ring and place it on the table.
Step 2: pick up the yellow ring and place it on the table.
Step 3: pick up the red ring and place it on the table.
Step 4: pick up the red ring and place it on the pole.
Step 5: pick up the yellow ring and place it on top of the red ring on the pole.
Step 6: pick up the blue ring and place it on top of the yellow ring on the pole.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 100/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 87/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan achieves the task goal and includes all essential steps (Completeness: 100). The order of operations is logical but has inefficiencies when compared to the more optimal ground-truth sequence (Correctness: 90). Lastly, while the instructions are understandable, they could be simplified for better efficiency and clarity (Clarity: 70)

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 100/100**  
  The model-generated plan covers all essential steps for completing the task of arranging the rings (red, yellow, blue) on the pole in the correct order. It does not miss any critical operation.

- **Correctness: 90/100**  
  The task sequence in the model's plan includes a preparatory step (placing all rings on the table) that deviates slightly from the simpler, direct sequence in the ground-truth plan. While logically consistent, these extra motions could introduce inefficiency. However, the final ordering and placement of the rings on the pole are correct.

- **Clarity: 70/100**  
  The model's instructions are somewhat verbose and redundant. For example, steps like "place it on the table" appear unnecessary unless the task explicitly required it. While the low-level executor can interpret each step, the additional steps may create confusion or inefficiency. The task could be described more concisely and still stay within the executor's capacity.

- **Mean Score: 87/100**
