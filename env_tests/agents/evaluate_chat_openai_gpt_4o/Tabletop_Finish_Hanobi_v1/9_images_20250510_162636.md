# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Finish-Hanobi-v1 (9 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the red one to the right
Step 2: move the yellow one to the right
Step 3: move the blue one to the top of right
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the blue ring and put it on the holder
Step 2: pick up the red ring and put it on the holder
Step 3: pick up the yellow ring and put it on the holder
Step 4: rotate the holder till the hole upward
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 63/100

## Justification
**  
  While the model-generated plan contains clear, executable low-level steps, it does not fulfill the intended task goal due to omissions and a misalignment in order of operations (completeness and correctness issues). Additionally, the inclusion of an unnecessary step ("rotate the holder") detracts from overall correctness. However, the clarity remains high, as the steps are expressed in an understandable format that adheres to the robot executor's requirements

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 50/100**  
  The model-generated plan partially aligns with the task goal, which involves arranging rings (Hanobi-like task). However, it fails to include explicit details for moving the rings to the exact "right" and "top of right" positions, as outlined in the ground-truth plan. It deviates from the intended hierarchical sequencing of moving the red, yellow, and blue rings described in the ground-truth plan.

- **Correctness: 60/100**  
  The model-generated plan incorrectly sequences the ring placement order: it starts by moving the blue ring first, contrary to the ground-truth order (red → yellow → blue). While the steps are logical in isolation, they do not adhere to the stacked dependencies characteristic of the Hanobi task, where certain rings must be placed only after others. The final step of rotating the holder adds an unnecessary action unaligned with the task goal. 

- **Clarity: 80/100**  
  The steps are clearly described and conform to the expected low-level executor language (e.g., "pick up the [ring] and put it on the holder"). The sequence is understandable to a robot executor, even though it is not logically aligned with the task objective. There’s some ambiguity regarding why the "rotate the holder" step is performed, which slightly reduces clarity.

- **Mean Score: 63.3/100**  
  _(Average of the three criteria)_

- **Justification:**  
  While the model-generated plan contains clear, executable low-level steps, it does not fulfill the intended task goal due to omissions and a misalignment in order of operations (completeness and correctness issues). Additionally, the inclusion of an unnecessary step ("rotate the holder") detracts from overall correctness.
