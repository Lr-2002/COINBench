# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Finish-Hanobi-v1 (8 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the red one to the right
Step 2: move the yellow one to the right
Step 3: move the blue one to the top of right
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the largest ring and put it on the marker
Step 2: pick up the medium ring and put it on the marker
Step 3: pick up the smallest ring and put it on the marker
Step 4: stack all the cube (rings)
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 65/100
- Mean Score: 52/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan diverges from the ground-truth plan in terms of essential steps (Completeness) and logical order (Correctness). While clear enough for a low-level executor (Clarity), it fails to structure the rings in the hierarchical arrangement specified in Tabletop-Finish-Hanobi-v1. Therefore, the overall score is primarily limited by its deviation from the defined task goal

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 50/100  
The model-generated plan includes essential handling steps for the rings (largest, medium, smallest) but diverges significantly from the ground-truth plan, which specifies moving objects to predefined positions (e.g., "right" or "top of right"). Critical locations specified in the GT plan are missed, and the model’s instructions seem focused more on stacking without achieving the hierarchical arrangement described in the task goal.

- **Correctness**: 40/100  
The model’s plan deviates from logical correctness as per the goal. Hanobi tasks involve precise ordering, moving smaller objects first or keeping larger objects at the base. The step order seems arbitrary, and stacking rings (described as cubes in step 4) may not fulfill the hierarchical arrangement intended by the ground-truth instructions. Sequential logic is incorrect for solving the task.

- **Clarity**: 65/100  
The model-generated plan uses understandable low-level instructions like "pick up the X and put it on the marker" and "stack all the cube (rings)." These are generally clear for the executor, though there are misleading references ("stack all the cube"), and the instructions lead to potential confusion due to the lack of tie-in with the GT structure. The task does not align with the intended low-level executor’s specific requirements.

- **Mean Score**: 52/100
