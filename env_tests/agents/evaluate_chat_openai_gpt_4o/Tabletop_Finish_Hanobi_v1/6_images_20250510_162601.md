# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Finish-Hanobi-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the red one to the right
Step 2: move the yellow one to the right
Step 3: move the blue one to the top of right
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the yellow ring and put it on the first peg
Step 2: pick up the red ring and put it on top of the yellow ring on the first peg
Step 3: pick up the blue ring and put it on top of the red ring on the first peg
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 95/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 90/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan successfully details all essential steps necessary to complete the task goal of organizing the rings in their proper order on the first peg. It breaks down the task into explicit manipulations of each ring but slightly overlooks the potential for higher-level abstraction compared to the ground-truth plan. Hence, near-perfect but slightly fragmented completion.  
  - **Correctness:** The model's sequential order is correct for the specific task, aligning logically with the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. However, the human-annotated plan uses more generalized descriptions with positional references rather than specific handling instructions for low-level execution. The model instructions are slightly more specific than necessary, which might complicate adherence to implicit rules or tasks requiring flexibility.  
  - **Clarity:** While the descriptions are clear and actionable at the low-level executor level, minor improvements are possible to align instructions seamlessly with the task goal in a way that avoids redundancy. For example, more exact references to the pegs and their function could improve clarity
