# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Finish-Hanobi-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the red one to the right
Step 2: move the yellow one to the right
Step 3: move the blue one to the top of right
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the red ring and place it on the target peg.
Step 2: pick up the yellow ring and place it on top of the red ring on the target peg.
Step 3: pick up the blue ring and place it on top of the yellow ring on the target peg.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 100/100
- Correctness: 95/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 95/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan includes all essential steps required to achieve the task goal. Both the ground-truth and model's plans involve sequentially placing the rings (red, yellow, blue) on the target peg, satisfying the task objective.  
  - **Correctness**: The steps are logically correct and sequentially aligned, as the rings are stacked in the proper order. Minor adjustments to low-level instructions (e.g., explicitly mentioning the rings as objects rather than colors) could slightly improve correctness for execution.  
  - **Clarity**: While the descriptions are clear to a human and align with the task goal, they can be more explicit for a low-level executor. For example, "place it on the target peg" lacks precision about "position the ring on the peg" or "locate the specific target peg," slightly reducing clarity
