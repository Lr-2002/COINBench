# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Finish-Hanobi-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the red one to the right
Step 2: move the yellow one to the right
Step 3: move the blue one to the top of right
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: find and pick the largest cube
Step 2: put the largest cube in the stacking area
Step 3: find and pick the second largest cube
Step 4: stack the second largest cube on top of the largest cube
Step 5: find and pick the third largest cube
Step 6: stack the third largest cube on top of the second largest cube
Step 7: repeat the process until all cubes are stacked in order from big to small
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 80/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan is conceptually aligned with the task goal but lacks the precise step-wise breakdown evident in the human-annotated plan. It is reasonably complete in addressing the task but misses some specifics and includes higher-level instructions that are less suitable for the low-level executor. Correctness suffers somewhat due to a looser adherence to the specific sequence provided in the ground-truth plan. Clarity is the weakest area due to the use of abstract instructions and lack of explicit object references critical for low-level execution

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 80/100**  
  The model-generated plan effectively describes the stacking process, but it introduces a broader and slightly abstract step ("repeat the process until all cubes are stacked in order from big to small") rather than detailing how to manipulate specific objects (red, yellow, blue). It does cover the essence of the task but lacks specifics that align directly with the ground-truth plan.

- **Correctness: 70/100**  
  The logical structure of stacking cubes from largest to smallest is correct. However, the step order deviates from the explicit instructions in the ground-truth plan ("move the red one to the right," etc.) because it doesn’t specify manipulating individual objects in the specific sequence (red, yellow, blue). This reflects some misalignment with the task expectation.

- **Clarity: 60/100**  
  The model-generated plan is somewhat clear but uses higher-level abstractions unsuitable for a low-level executor. For example, instructions like “find and pick the largest cube” are not as explicit or low-level as "move the red one to the right." The final step, "repeat the process until all cubes are stacked in order from big to small," is also vague and lacks sufficient detail for execution.

- **Mean Score: 70/100**
