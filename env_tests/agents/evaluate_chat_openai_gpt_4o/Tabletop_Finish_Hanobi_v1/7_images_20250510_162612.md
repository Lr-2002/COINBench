# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Finish-Hanobi-v1 (7 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the red one to the right
Step 2: move the yellow one to the right
Step 3: move the blue one to the top of right
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Remove the yellow ring from the pole.
Step 2: Remove the red ring from the pole.
Step 3: Remove the blue ring from the pole.
Step 4: Place the blue ring on the pole as the bottom ring.
Step 5: Place the red ring on top of the blue ring.
Step 6: Place the yellow ring on top of the red ring.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 100/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 95/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan is complete and clearly articulated, ensuring the task can be executed effectively. Its minor inefficiency in the order of ring removal detracts slightly from correctness but still accomplishes the goal

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 100/100  
The model-generated plan includes all necessary steps to complete the task. It accurately details the steps for moving the rings and stacking them in the correct order, aligning with the ultimate goal.

- **Correctness**: 90/100  
The steps are logically sound and sequentially correct. However, the order in which the rings are removed (yellow, red, blue) deviates from the ground-truth plan (red, yellow, blue). While this doesn't compromise the end result, it is less efficient than the optimal order suggested by the ground-truth plan.

- **Clarity**: 95/100  
The steps are presented in a clear, understandable manner compatible with the low-level executor. Each step precisely specifies the actions to perform on the rings and the target configuration. Minor improvement could enhance conciseness (e.g., omitting "Remove the blue ring from the pole" when it isn't strictly necessary for plan clarity).

- **Mean Score**: 95/100  

- **Justification**: The model-generated plan is complete and clearly articulated, ensuring the task can be executed effectively. Its minor inefficiency in the order of ring removal detracts slightly from correctness but still accomplishes the goal.
