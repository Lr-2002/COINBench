# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Finish-Hanobi-v1 (10 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the red one to the right
Step 2: move the yellow one to the right
Step 3: move the blue one to the top of right
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the blue ring and place it on the peg
Step 2: pick up the red ring and place it on top of the blue ring on the peg
Step 3: pick up the yellow ring and place it on top of the red ring on the peg
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 75/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 83/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan captures the essential steps for accomplishing the task, but the ordering of objects is different from the ground-truth (red, yellow, blue in GT plan versus blue, red, yellow in the generated plan). This discrepancy creates ambiguity regarding whether the stack’s final order is essential for goal completion. Assuming the task of placing all rings on the peg fulfills the objective, this plan is considered mostly complete but slightly off on execution order.  
  - **Correctness**: The generated plan has a logical sequence: starting with placing the base (blue ring), followed by stacking the others. However, the order does not match the ground truth, which may result in a failure to achieve the intended task (e.g., issues with spatial constraints). This impacts the sequential correctness.  
  - **Clarity**: The instructions are concise and follow the low-level executor format, making them understandable. However, slight adjustments in phrasing (e.g., explicitly using “put blue ring on right peg”) could improve task fidelity.
