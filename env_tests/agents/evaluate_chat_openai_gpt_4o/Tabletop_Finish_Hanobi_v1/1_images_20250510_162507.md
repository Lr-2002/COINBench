# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Finish-Hanobi-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the red one to the right
Step 2: move the yellow one to the right
Step 3: move the blue one to the top of right
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Pick up the blue hanobi ring from its current peg.
Step 2: Place the blue hanobi ring on the target peg.
Step 3: Pick up the yellow hanobi ring from its current peg.
Step 4: Place the yellow hanobi ring on top of the blue hanobi ring on the target peg.
Step 5: Pick up the red hanobi ring from its current peg.
Step 6: Place the red hanobi ring on top of the yellow hanobi ring on the target peg.

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 100/100
- Correctness: 100/100
- Clarity: 75/100
- Mean Score: 92/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan is complete, correct, and logically sequenced, covering all task requirements. However, its clarity slightly falls short of matching the specific format required for low-level executors. Reformatting the steps would improve clarity further

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 100/100**  
  The model-generated plan includes all essential steps needed to accomplish the task goal, aligning fully with the ground-truth plan. It covers moving the blue, yellow, and red rings to the target area while maintaining the stacking order.  

- **Correctness: 100/100**  
  The steps follow a logically and sequentially correct order. The model-generated plan moves the rings in the appropriate hierarchy (blue → yellow → red) from their initial positions to the target positioning, ensuring the task goal is achieved without violating rules.  

- **Clarity: 75/100**  
  Although the plan is clear, the instructions are not formatted optimally for the low-level executor as defined (e.g., "<action> the <object>"). For instance, steps like "Pick up the blue hanobi ring from its current peg" could have been written as "pick up the blue hanobi ring" and "place the blue hanobi ring on the target peg" could have been "put the blue hanobi ring on the target peg." While the description is understandable, it requires slight rephrasing to match the clarity standard for low-level execution.  

- **Mean Score: 91.67/100**  

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan is complete, correct, and logically sequenced, covering all task requirements. However, its clarity slightly falls short of matching the specific format required for low-level executors. Reformatting the steps would improve clarity further.
