# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Finish-Hanobi-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: move the red one to the right
Step 2: move the yellow one to the right
Step 3: move the blue one to the top of right
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the blue hanobi ring and place it on the table.
Step 2: pick up the yellow hanobi ring and place it on the table.
Step 3: pick up the red hanobi ring and place it on the target pole.
Step 4: pick up the yellow hanobi ring and place it on top of the red hanobi ring on the target pole.
Step 5: pick up the blue hanobi ring and place it on top of the yellow hanobi ring on the target pole.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 85/100

## Justification
- **Completeness** is rated highly because all essential steps for task completion are included (even with additional detail).  
- **Correctness** is slightly lower due to deviations that introduce inefficiencies into the sequence compared to the ground-truth plan.  
- **Clarity** is reasonably strong but slightly hindered by verbosity and unnecessary intermediate steps

### Evaluation of the Model-Generated Plan

#### Completeness: 90/100
The model-generated plan includes all the essential steps necessary to achieve the goal of moving the blue hanobi ring on top of the yellow and red rings on the target pole. However, the model elaborates significantly and introduces additional intermediate steps (e.g., placing rings on the table before stacking). While these steps may not be strictly necessary based on the ground-truth plan, they do not omit any required actions for completing the task.

#### Correctness: 85/100
The logical order is mostly correct and adheres to the sequencing where the smaller rings must be stacked first, followed by the larger rings on top. However, it deviates slightly from the ground-truth plan by introducing intermediate steps (placing rings on the table temporarily); this abstraction was not outlined in the original plan and could cause inefficiencies if unnecessary handling actions were implemented incorrectly.

#### Clarity: 80/100
The model-generated plan is clear and describes each action in terms compatible with the low-level executor (e.g., "pick up the blue hanobi ring and place it on the table"). However, the consistent use of intermediate steps that differ from the ground-truth plan could make it less intuitive, especially when the low-level executor might not need redundant actions for temporary placement. Streamlining such instructions would improve clarity.

#### Mean Score: 85/100  
#### Justification:
- **Completeness** is rated highly because all essential steps for task completion are included (even with additional detail).  
- **Correctness** is slightly lower due to deviations that introduce inefficiencies into the sequence compared to the ground-truth plan.  
- **Clarity** is reasonably strong but slightly hindered by verbosity and unnecessary intermediate steps.
