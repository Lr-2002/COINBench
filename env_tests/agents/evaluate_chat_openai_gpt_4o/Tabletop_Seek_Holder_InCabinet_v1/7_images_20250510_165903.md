# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Holder-InCabinet-v1 (7 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open cabinet door
Step 2: pick left holder
Step 3: pick right holder
Step 4: pick the holder containing the eraser
Step 5: put the eraser to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the holder containing the eraser
Step 2: put the holder to the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 57/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits critical steps such as "open cabinet door" and picking up all relevant holders sequentially before determining the one containing the eraser. These steps are essential to ensure the eraser is located and retrieved per the task goal.  
  - **Correctness**: The described steps are logically correct but deviate from the sequential order in the ground-truth plan. The step to "pick up the holder containing the eraser" should only happen after identifying the holder, which requires steps like inspecting or picking all holders. While the model-generated plan may appear to shortcut, it lacks intermediate steps requiring clearer logical progression.  
  - **Clarity**: The model-generated steps are executable and provided in a clear format, easily interpretable by the low-level executor. However, the second step, "put the holder to the marker," is slightly ambiguous and might confuse the executor, as it was intended to put the **eraser** to the marker in the task goal. This impacts the clarity score
