## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 40/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan skips several necessary steps from the ground-truth plan, such as opening the cabinet door, identifying and sequentially picking up all holders, and isolating the holder containing the eraser. These steps are critical for achieving the task goal comprehensively.  
  - **Correctness**: The proposed plan starts mid-task ("pick up the holder containing the eraser") without acknowledging that earlier essential steps (like opening the cabinet or identifying the correct holder) have already been completed. The action "put the holder to the marker" is also incorrect for the goal, as the eraser, not the holder, needs to be placed on the marker.  
  - **Clarity**: While the plan is phrased in a relatively clear and low-level executor-friendly manner, the steps are incomplete and misaligned with the goal. The language "put the holder to the marker" is misleading and not a valid instruction for achieving the target outcome
