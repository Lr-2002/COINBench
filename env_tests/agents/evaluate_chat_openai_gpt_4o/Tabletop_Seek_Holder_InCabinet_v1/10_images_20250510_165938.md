## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 50/100

## Justification
- *Completeness*: The model-generated plan is incomplete as it skips essential steps from the ground-truth plan, such as **opening the cabinet door**, differentiating between the left and right holders, locating the holder with the eraser, and finally transferring the eraser to the marker. It only vaguely addresses picking up a holder and placing it on the marker.  
  - *Correctness*: The step sequence is partially logical in the context of manipulating a holder, but it omits necessary preparatory actions like locating the eraser-containing holder and opening the cabinet door. Without these, tasks like picking the correct holder and achieving the goal cannot succeed.   
  - *Clarity*: While the instructions "pick up the holder" and "put the holder to the marker" match the low-level executor's accepted format, they are too vague and lack specificity (e.g., which holder to select and why). This makes the generated steps insufficiently descriptive for achieving the goal accurately
