# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Holder-InCabinet-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open cabinet door
Step 2: pick left holder
Step 3: pick right holder
Step 4: pick the holder containing the eraser
Step 5: put the eraser to the marker
```

```
Step 1: pick up the holder from the cabinet
Step 2: put the holder to the marker
Step 3: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan misses critical steps such as opening the cabinet door, correctly identifying and picking specific holders (e.g., the one containing the eraser), and transferring the eraser itself to the marker. It skips several essential actions.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence lacks logical progression with respect to the task goal. The generated plan does not open the cabinet to access the holder, and it prematurely closes the cabinet without completing the eraser-handling subtask. Additionally, putting the "holder to the marker" is inaccurate—not specified in the goal.  
  - **Clarity:** While the instructions are clear and executable by a low-level executor, the absence of specific identifiers like "holder containing the eraser" makes the steps ambiguous in their alignment with the goal
