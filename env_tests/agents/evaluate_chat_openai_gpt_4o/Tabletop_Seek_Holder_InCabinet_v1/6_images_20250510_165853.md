# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Holder-InCabinet-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open cabinet door
Step 2: pick left holder
Step 3: pick right holder
Step 4: pick the holder containing the eraser
Step 5: put the eraser to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the holder containing the eraser
Step 2: put the holder to the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan is missing critical steps such as "open cabinet door" to access the holders and actions for handling other holders, as shown in the ground-truth plan. It also skips "pick left holder" and "pick right holder" before identifying the one containing the eraser.  
   - **Correctness**: The plan has a logical sequence conditional to having already retrieved the correct holder. However, it incorrectly assumes prior steps (like opening the cabinet or handling other holders) are already completed, which is a flaw in the logical progression of the overall task.  
   - **Clarity**: The instructions are described in a concise and understandable manner for a low-level executor. However, it's not quite precise compared to the ground-truth plan. For example, instead of "put the holder to the marker," it should have referenced the eraser explicitly.

Overall, the model's plan assumes prior knowledge of progress in the task and fails to include necessary initial steps, which greatly impacts its completeness and correctness. Clarity is somewhat better but still not perfect.
