# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Holder-InCabinet-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open cabinet door
Step 2: pick left holder
Step 3: pick right holder
Step 4: pick the holder containing the eraser
Step 5: put the eraser to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: locate the holder containing the eraser
Step 3: pick up the holder and put it on the marker
Step 4: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
** While the model-generated plan captures some high-level elements relevant to the task goal, it fails to include essential steps for achieving the detailed task (completeness), introduces logical inaccuracies (correctness), and lacks sufficient clarity for low-level execution

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 50/100**
  - The model-generated plan misses essential steps from the ground-truth plan, such as handling the holders correctly and transferring the eraser to the marker explicitly. It skips the intermediate actions of identifying and picking up holders that are not explicitly described. Therefore, it is incomplete.

- **Correctness: 60/100**
  - While the model-generated plan has steps that are logically sequential, it shows a misunderstanding of the task logic. Specifically, it conflates the "holder with the eraser" directly being positioned on the marker instead of ensuring the eraser itself is transferred. The ordering of steps themselves (e.g., opening the cabinet) is correct but not executed completely as per required logic.

- **Clarity: 70/100**
  - The instructions in the model-generated plan lack precision compared to the low-level executor's requirements. For instance, "pick up the holder and put it on the marker" is less clear than explicitly stating the transfer of the eraser. The ground truth plan provides unambiguous instructions for every step, which is preferable for low-level execution.

- **Mean Score: 60/100**
  - **Justification:** While the model-generated plan captures some high-level elements relevant to the task goal, it fails to include essential steps for achieving the detailed task (completeness), introduces logical inaccuracies (correctness), and lacks sufficient clarity for low-level execution.
