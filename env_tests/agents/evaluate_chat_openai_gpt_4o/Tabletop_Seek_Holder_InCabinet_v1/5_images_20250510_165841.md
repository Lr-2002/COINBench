```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
**Completeness**: The model-generated plan misses essential steps from the ground-truth plan, such as opening the cabinet door to access the holders and identifying/selecting multiple holders before picking the holder containing the eraser. Additionally, the eraser needs to be put on the marker, not the holder. This results in a significant gap in completeness.

- **Justification**:  
  **Completeness**: The model-generated plan misses essential steps from the ground-truth plan, such as opening the cabinet door to access the holders and identifying/selecting multiple holders before picking the holder containing the eraser. Additionally, the eraser needs to be put on the marker, not the holder. This results in a significant gap in completeness.  

  **Correctness**: While the model-generated plan has some logical steps (e.g., identifying the object with the eraser), the sequence is fundamentally flawed. It skips critical preceding steps (e.g., opening the cabinet door) necessary for correctly completing the task goal. There is also a logical error in "putting the holder to the marker" instead of the eraser itself.  

  **Clarity**: The instructions are mostly clear and concise, adhering to the low-level executor's instruction format. However, incorrect descriptions such as "put the holder to the marker" instead of the intended "put the eraser to the marker" introduce potential confusion.
