# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Holder-InCabinet-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open cabinet door
Step 2: pick left holder
Step 3: pick right holder
Step 4: pick the holder containing the eraser
Step 5: put the eraser to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: find the holder containing the eraser
Step 3: pick up the holder containing the eraser
Step 4: put the holder to the marker
Step 5: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan demonstrates reasonable clarity and logical sequencing but fails to fully accomplish the task due to the omission of key steps (placing the eraser) and the inclusion of non-essential actions (closing the cabinet door). While easy to follow, the instructions fall short of guiding the low-level executor to complete the task goal

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 60/100**  
The model-generated plan partially accomplishes the task goal but omits essential steps. While it correctly identifies and interacts with the holder containing the eraser, it fails to actually **remove the eraser from the holder** and put the eraser on the marker (ground truth Step 5). This results in an incomplete task execution. Additionally, it unnecessarily includes a step to "close the cabinet door," which was not required in the ground-truth plan.

- **Correctness: 70/100**  
The sequence of steps in the model-generated plan is mostly logical. It begins by opening the cabinet door and finding the correct holder before picking it up. However, Step 4 ("put the holder to the marker") is a logical error compared to the task's goal: **the eraser, not the entire holder, should be placed on the marker.** Closing the cabinet door at the end is unnecessary and does not align with the logical flow indicated by the ground truth.

- **Clarity: 80/100**  
The model-generated plan's steps are written clearly and use specific low-level actions like "open the cabinet door" and "pick up the holder containing the eraser." However, Step 4 introduces confusion by saying "put the holder to the marker" instead of providing an instruction for extracting the eraser and placing it on the marker. This decreases clarity for the low-level executor. Additionally, "find the holder containing the eraser" might suggest ambiguity, as the low-level executor may not have the capability to interpret symbolic "find" commands.

- **Mean Score: 70/100**  

- **Justification:**  
The model-generated plan demonstrates reasonable clarity and logical sequencing but fails to fully accomplish the task due to the omission of key steps (placing the eraser) and the inclusion of non-essential actions (closing the cabinet door). While easy to follow, the instructions fall short of guiding the low-level executor to complete the task goal.
