# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Holder-InCabinet-v1 (9 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open cabinet door
Step 2: pick left holder
Step 3: pick right holder
Step 4: pick the holder containing the eraser
Step 5: put the eraser to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the holder containing the eraser
Step 2: put the holder to the marker
Step 3: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 47/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness (40/100):** The model-generated plan skips important steps included in the ground-truth plan, such as opening the cabinet door and picking up both the left and right holders. While it focuses on the ultimate subtask (picking the holder with the eraser and putting it to the marker), the broader steps required to ensure the task goal is fully met are missing.  
  - **Correctness (30/100):** The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan seems flawed. For instance, it is illogical to "pick up the holder containing the eraser" without first opening the cabinet door, which is necessary for access. Additionally, the "close the cabinet door" action is premature, as it might obstruct completing unfinished steps.  
  - **Clarity (70/100):** The steps described in the model-generated plan are clear and understandable for a low-level executor, adhering to the required instruction format. However, the clarity is somewhat diminished by the lack of context or preparation actions (e.g., no "open cabinet door" instruction).

Together, the model-generated plan shows some understanding of the task goal but falls short in both completeness and logical sequencing. Its clarity is the strongest aspect but does not compensate for its other deficiencies.
