# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Holder-InCabinet-v1 (8 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open cabinet door
Step 2: pick left holder
Step 3: pick right holder
Step 4: pick the holder containing the eraser
Step 5: put the eraser to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pick up the holder containing the eraser
Step 3: put the holder to the marker
Step 4: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
- **Completeness** is rated lower due to the omission of critical identification steps and the neglect of transferring the eraser specifically to the marker.
- **Correctness** is moderately rated because while the sequence is mostly logical, it makes unsupported assumptions and deviates from the intended procedure described in the ground-truth plan.
- **Clarity** is scored higher, as the instructions are comprehensible for the low-level executor, but slightly reduced due to ambiguity around the task goal

### Evaluation of Model-Generated Plan:

#### Completeness: 60/100  
The model-generated plan misses important steps included in the ground-truth plan. Specifically, it does not address picking each holder to identify the one containing the eraser. Instead, it directly picks the holder containing the eraser, which assumes prior knowledge not explicitly mentioned or derived from the instructions. Additionally, the final task described in the ground-truth plan (“put the eraser to the marker”) is omitted in favor of placing the entire holder containing the eraser on the marker, which diverges from the specified goal in the ground-truth plan. 

#### Correctness: 70/100  
The sequence of steps in the model-generated plan is logically correct, but the omission of identifying the correct holder breaks the workflow. The assumption that the holder containing the eraser can be directly picked is inconsistent with the logical progression of the task as described in the ground-truth plan, where identifying the holder by picking each one is required. Closing the cabinet door at the end is not indicated in the ground-truth plan, which could represent an unnecessary deviation from the intended procedure. 

#### Clarity: 80/100  
The steps are described in a clear and understandable manner, suitable for the low-level executor. All steps conform to the instruction format (e.g., "open the cabinet door," "pick up the holder containing the eraser," etc.). However, the action described in Step 3 ("put the holder to the marker") deviates from clarity regarding the actual task goal described in the ground-truth plan ("put the eraser to the marker"), which could confuse the executor when goals are misaligned.

#### Mean Score: 70/100  

#### Justification:
- **Completeness** is rated lower due to the omission of critical identification steps and the neglect of transferring the eraser specifically to the marker.
- **Correctness** is moderately rated because while the sequence is mostly logical, it makes unsupported assumptions and deviates from the intended procedure described in the ground-truth plan.
- **Clarity** is scored higher, as the instructions are comprehensible for the low-level executor, but slightly reduced due to ambiguity around the task goal.
