# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Holder-InCabinet-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open cabinet door
Step 2: pick left holder
Step 3: pick right holder
Step 4: pick the holder containing the eraser
Step 5: put the eraser to the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: find and pick the holder containing the eraser from the cabinet
Step 3: put the holder to the marker
Step 4: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan skips picking up the additional holders (left and right holders) mentioned in the ground-truth plan, possibly missing an important intermediate step to differentiate the target holder (if necessary). It assumes the holder with the eraser can be directly identified without examining the other holders, leading to partial completeness.  
  - **Correctness**: While the generated steps are logical and sequential (e.g., the cabinet door is opened first, the target holder is identified, and the final item is placed in the marker), the substitution of "put the holder to the marker" instead of transferring the "eraser" directly violates the logical goal. The robot is tasked to put the **eraser** on the marker, not the holder containing the eraser, so this is a deviation from correctness.  
  - **Clarity**: The steps in the plan are described clearly with unambiguous instructions that fit the low-level executor’s requirements. For example, "open the cabinet door," "find and pick," and "put the holder to the marker" follow the expected action-object format. However, there’s a slight ambiguity regarding the exact extraction of the eraser, leading to a slight penalty
