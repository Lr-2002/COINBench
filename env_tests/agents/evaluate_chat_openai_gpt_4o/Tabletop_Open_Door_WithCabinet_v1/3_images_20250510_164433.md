# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Open-Door-WithCabinet-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: close the cabinet
Step 2: open the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 100/100
- Mean Score: 67/100

## Justification
**  
  * **Completeness:** The model-generated plan omits the essential step of "close the cabinet" from the ground-truth plan, which is necessary for achieving the task goal as specified. This results in a significant deduction in completeness.  
  * **Correctness:** The sequence of operations (starting with "open the door") is valid but incomplete because it assumes that the cabinet is already closed, which is not guaranteed unless explicitly instructed. Therefore, the logical sequence may fail depending on the environment, earning it a partial score.  
  * **Clarity:** The single step "open the door" is described in a clear and concise manner that aligns with the format interpretable by the low-level executor. Hence, it receives full marks for clarity
