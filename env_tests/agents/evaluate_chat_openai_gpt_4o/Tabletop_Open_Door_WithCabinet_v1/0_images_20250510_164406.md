# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Open-Door-WithCabinet-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: close the cabinet
Step 2: open the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan lacks the essential step of closing the cabinet, which is necessary to achieve the task goal as defined in the ground-truth plan. Hence, it only partially addresses the task and scores 50.  
  - **Correctness**: The single step included in the plan ("open the door") is logically correct for the task and in the proper sequence. However, the omission of the first required step (closing the cabinet) means that the sequence is incomplete, reducing the score.  
  - **Clarity**: The single step is described clearly and in a format that is understandable to the low-level executor, scoring high on clarity
