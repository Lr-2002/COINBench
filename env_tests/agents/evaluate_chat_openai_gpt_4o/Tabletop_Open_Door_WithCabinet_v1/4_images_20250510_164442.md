# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Open-Door-WithCabinet-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: close the cabinet
Step 2: open the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 100/100
- Mean Score: 67/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits the essential first step from the ground-truth plan, which is to "close the cabinet." This makes the plan incomplete as it starts from an incorrect state assumption. Hence, the score is reduced significantly.  
   - **Correctness**: The provided step itself ("open the door") is logically correct but assumes a precondition (the closed cabinet) has been satisfied. Since it doesn't account for the necessary prior action (closing the cabinet), the order is partially incorrect.  
   - **Clarity**: The single step provided is clear and adheres to the format required for the low-level executor, earning full marks for clarity
