# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Open-Door-WithCabinet-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: close the cabinet
Step 2: open the door
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: grasp the door handle
Step 2: pull the door handle to open the door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 67/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan addresses the subtask of opening the door with sufficient clarity and logical sequencing but fails to consider the overall context of the task, specifically ignoring the step to "close the cabinet." Therefore, while it is clear and partially correct, it is incomplete

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 50/100**  
  The model-generated plan does not include the step "close the cabinet,‚Äù which is essential as per the ground-truth plan. It only addresses opening the door, omitting the need to first close the cabinet.

- **Correctness: 70/100**  
  The model-generated steps ("grasp the door handle" and "pull the door handle to open the door") are logically correct for opening the door and are sequentially ordered. However, since it skips the prerequisite step of closing the cabinet, it violates the overall task sequence described in the ground-truth plan.

- **Clarity: 80/100**  
  The model-generated instructions are clear and can be understood by a low-level executor. The actions are described concisely and in appropriate <action> the <object> format. However, they don't describe the entire task from the beginning (e.g., closing the cabinet) clearly.

- **Mean Score: 67/100**  

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan addresses the subtask of opening the door with sufficient clarity and logical sequencing but fails to consider the overall context of the task, specifically ignoring the step to "close the cabinet." Therefore, while it is clear and partially correct, it is incomplete.
