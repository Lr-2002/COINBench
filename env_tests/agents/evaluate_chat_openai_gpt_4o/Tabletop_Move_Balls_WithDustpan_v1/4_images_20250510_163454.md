# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Balls-WithDustpan-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the dustpan
Step 2: squeeze all the ball into the dustpan
Step 3: move all the ball into the container with the dustpan
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Use the dustpan to scoop the balls from the tabletop.
Step 2: Move the dustpan with the balls to the holder.
Step 3: Tilt the dustpan to pour the balls into the holder.
Step 4: Verify if all balls are inside the holder.
Step 5: Repeat the process if any balls remain outside the holder.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan deviates notably in precision compared to the ground-truth plan by introducing redundant or intermediate steps ("holder" instead of "container") and using unclear phrasing for robotic executors. While it partially addresses the task goal, it fails to align clearly and correctly with the outlined intent and low-level executor requirements

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness**: 70/100  
  - The model-generated plan covers essential steps like scooping, moving, and transferring the balls. However, it diverges from the task goal by using the "holder" (instead of "container") as an intermediate location. This is unnecessary and deviates slightly from the target plan.

- **Correctness**: 60/100  
  - The sequence contains logical steps, but it introduces ambiguity by involving additional steps like "Verify if all balls are inside the holder" and "Repeat the process," which diverge from the simpler, more direct ground-truth process. Step 2 and Step 3 also imply interaction with an intermediate "holder" that isn't part of the original task.

- **Clarity**: 50/100  
  - The generated plan steps include descriptions that are verbose and not clearly formatted for a low-level executor. For instance, "Use the dustpan to scoop the balls" is less clear than simply "squeeze the balls into the dustpan." Similarly, "Verify" and "Repeat the process" instructions are abstract and do not align well with the strict instruction style required for a robot manipulator.

- **Mean Score**: 60/100  

- **Justification**: The model-generated plan deviates notably in precision compared to the ground-truth plan by introducing redundant or intermediate steps ("holder" instead of "container") and using unclear phrasing for robotic executors. While it partially addresses the task goal, it fails to align clearly and correctly with the outlined intent and low-level executor requirements.
