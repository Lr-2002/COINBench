# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Balls-WithDustpan-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the dustpan
Step 2: squeeze all the ball into the dustpan
Step 3: move all the ball into the container with the dustpan
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick up the dustpan with the balls
Step 2: tilt the dustpan to pour the balls into the holder
Step 3: ensure all balls are inside the holder
Step 4: place the dustpan back on the table
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
- **Completeness (50)**: Misses a key preparatory step (squeezing balls) and deviates from the correct target (container vs. holder).
- **Correctness (60)**: Logical sequence of actions, but misses alignment with the task goal, leading to partial correctness.
- **Clarity (70)**: Mostly clear instructions, but one step ("ensure all balls...") could be clearer about corrective actions.

### Evaluation of Model-Generated Plan:

#### Completeness: 50/100
The model-generated plan does include some essential actions, such as interacting with the dustpan and moving the balls, but it diverges from the ground-truth plan in key ways. Specifically, the model does not explicitly include the critical step of "squeezing all the balls into the dustpan," which appears to be necessary in the GT plan. Additionally, it aims to move the balls "to the holder" rather than the container mentioned in the ground truth. This deviation demonstrates partial incompleteness.

#### Correctness: 60/100
The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan makes logical sense on its own and is sequentially consistent (e.g., picking up the dustpan, tilting it, ensuring all balls are properly placed, and putting it back). However, the actions target the "holder" rather than the "container," which deviates from the task goal as per the ground truth. Moreover, the logical necessity of squeezing the balls is omitted. While the internal logic is fine, the procedural steps are misaligned with the task requirements.

#### Clarity: 70/100
The steps in the model-generated plan are relatively clear and use understandable language for a low-level executor. Instructions like "pick up the dustpan," "tilt the dustpan," and "place the dustpan back on the table" conform to the required syntax. However, the step "ensure all balls are inside the holder" could potentially be vague for a low-level executor, as it does not specify what action to perform if balls are not inside the holder. Overall clarity is decent but not optimal.

#### Mean Score: 60/100

#### Justification:
- **Completeness (50)**: Misses a key preparatory step (squeezing balls) and deviates from the correct target (container vs. holder).
- **Correctness (60)**: Logical sequence of actions, but misses alignment with the task goal, leading to partial correctness.
- **Clarity (70)**: Mostly clear instructions, but one step ("ensure all balls...") could be clearer about corrective actions.

The model-generated plan demonstrates some coherence but falls short in aligning with the task requirements and the essential steps outlined in the ground-truth plan.
