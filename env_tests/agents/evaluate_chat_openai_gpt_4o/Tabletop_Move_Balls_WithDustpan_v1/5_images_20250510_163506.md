# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Balls-WithDustpan-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the dustpan
Step 2: squeeze all the ball into the dustpan
Step 3: move all the ball into the container with the dustpan
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Use the dustpan to gather the balls on the tabletop.
Step 2: Move the dustpan near the holder.
Step 3: Tilt the dustpan to pour the balls into the holder.
Step 4: Verify that all balls are inside the holder.
Step 5: Adjust the position of any remaining balls if necessary.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 50/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan captures some relevant steps but lacks critical actions, deviates from the task goal ("container" vs. "holder"), and includes redundant or unclear instructions. The failure to align with the simplicity needed for a low-level executor further reduces clarity and correctness. To match the benchmark, the plan requires enhanced alignment with the ground-truth plan and adherence to low-level instruction formatting

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 70/100**  
  The model-generated plan includes several relevant steps for accomplishing the task but misses key low-level specificity required for precise execution. For instance, it does not explicitly instruct the robot to "pick the dustpan" at the start, nor does it explicitly state "put the balls into the container," which are included in the ground-truth plan. Additionally, the reference to a "holder" may deviate from the stated final goal of moving balls into a "container."

- **Correctness: 60/100**  
  While the sequence of steps provided by the model is generally correct and logical, there are ambiguities that compromise the task flow. Specifically:
  - The plan skips the essential first step ("pick the dustpan").
  - Referring to a "holder" instead of a "container" raises concerns about task misalignment.
  - Step 4 ("Verify that all balls are inside the holder") is unnecessary for a low-level executor and deviates from the ground-truth emphasis on completing the task efficiently.

- **Clarity: 50/100**  
  The plan is not formulated consistently in low-level executor-friendly language. Actions like "Use the dustpan to gather the balls" and "Verify that all balls are inside the holder" do not adhere to the simple imperative syntax required (e.g., "squeeze all the balls into the dustpan"). Ambiguities ("holder" vs. "container") also reduce clarity.

- **Mean Score: 60/100**
