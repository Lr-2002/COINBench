# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Balls-WithDustpan-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the dustpan
Step 2: squeeze all the ball into the dustpan
Step 3: move all the ball into the container with the dustpan
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Locate the balls in the scene.
Step 2: Locate the dustpan in the scene.
Step 3: Pick up the dustpan.
Step 4: Use the dustpan to collect the balls.
Step 5: Put the balls into the holder using the dustpan.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 85/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 78/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan captures most of the intent of the task, but it diverges from the ground-truth plan by including unnecessary steps, slightly altering the goal terminology, and using vague language unsuitable for a low-level executor. These reduce its alignment to the benchmark requirements in terms of completeness, correctness, and clarity

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 85/100**  
The model-generated plan includes most of the essential steps from the ground-truth plan but adds unnecessary initial steps such as locating objects, which don't match the low-level instructions expected of the executor. Additionally, the final step refers to "holder" instead of "container," which misrepresents the task goal, potentially leaving ambiguity in achieving the goal.

- **Correctness: 80/100**  
While the overall structure of the model plan aligns with the logical progression of the task, the substitution of "container" with "holder" deviates from the ground-truth plan and the task goal. The ordering of actions is otherwise correct. However, unnecessary steps ("Locate the balls in the scene" and "Locate the dustpan in the scene") do not align with the strict sequence required by the executor.

- **Clarity: 70/100**  
The steps use general language rather than specific low-level action instructions the executor can follow. For example, "Use the dustpan to collect the balls" is imprecise compared to an instruction like "squeeze all the balls into the dustpan," making the plan less accessible for a low-level robotic system.

- **Mean Score: 78.33/100**  
(Computed as (85 + 80 + 70) / 3)

- **Justification:**  
The model-generated plan captures most of the intent of the task, but it diverges from the ground-truth plan by including unnecessary steps, slightly altering the goal terminology, and using vague language unsuitable for a low-level executor. These reduce its alignment to the benchmark requirements in terms of completeness, correctness, and clarity.
