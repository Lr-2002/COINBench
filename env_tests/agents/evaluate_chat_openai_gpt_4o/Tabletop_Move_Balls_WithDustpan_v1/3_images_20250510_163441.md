# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Balls-WithDustpan-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the dustpan
Step 2: squeeze all the ball into the dustpan
Step 3: move all the ball into the container with the dustpan
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: align the dustpan with the holder
Step 2: tilt the dustpan to pour the balls into the holder
Step 3: verify all balls are inside the holder
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 40/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 60/100
- Mean Score: 43/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan fails to include the essential step of picking the dustpan (an prerequisite action), and does not fully address the task's goal of moving balls into the container as described in the ground-truth plan. This results in significant missing actions required to fulfill the task. Hence, it scores low in completeness.  
  - **Correctness**: The sequence of steps provided in the model-generated plan deviates significantly from the logical order defined in the human-annotated ground-truth plan. The instructions to pour the balls into the holder and verify are unnecessary given the task description, and there is no direct alignment between its steps and the required end goal. Consequently, correctness is marked low.  
  - **Clarity**: The model-generated plan uses relatively clear language for a low-level executor, such as "align the dustpan" and "tilt the dustpan"; however, the steps are not directed towards the actual task goal specified. For example, "verify all balls are inside the holder" lacks clarity since it doesn't incorporate the final goal of moving balls into the container. Hence, clarity is better than other criteria, yet not highly rated
