# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Move-Balls-WithDustpan-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: pick the dustpan
Step 2: squeeze all the ball into the dustpan
Step 3: move all the ball into the container with the dustpan
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Pick up the dustpan with the balls.
Step 2: Move the dustpan closer to the holder.
Step 3: Tilt the dustpan to pour the balls into the holder.
Step 4: Verify all balls are inside the holder.
Step 5: Place the dustpan back on the table.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 60/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan partially addresses the task, but it lacks critical steps to meet the task goal fully. The substitution of "holder" for "container" introduces a goal mismatch, and the plan's initial state assumptions (balls already in the dustpan) ignore required actions described in the ground-truth. While logically structured, the steps require clear alignment with task objectives and initial conditions to be both correct and executable

## Raw GPT Response

### Evaluation:

#### Completeness: 60/100
The model-generated plan skips a critical initial step of "squeezing all the balls into the dustpan," which makes it incomplete. While it focuses on transferring balls into a holder (misinterpreted task goal), it doesn't fully address how the balls are first collected into the dustpan—a crucial part of the task.

#### Correctness: 50/100
While the plan includes logically sequential steps (picking up the dustpan, tilting to pour, etc.), it presumes that the dustpan already contains the balls—an essential setup step ignored. Additionally, it incorrectly directs the balls into a "holder" rather than the specified "container," which deviates from the ground-truth target. This misinterpretation of the goal affects the correctness.

#### Clarity: 70/100
Though the steps are understandable and mostly low-level, the actions lack precision and specificity needed for accurate execution. For example:
- "Pick up the dustpan with the balls" assumes a precondition not fulfilled.
- "Tilt the dustpan to pour the balls into the holder" specifies a "holder," which can create confusion since it's not the task goal ("container").

#### Mean Score: 60/100

#### Justification:
The model-generated plan partially addresses the task, but it lacks critical steps to meet the task goal fully. The substitution of "holder" for "container" introduces a goal mismatch, and the plan's initial state assumptions (balls already in the dustpan) ignore required actions described in the ground-truth.
