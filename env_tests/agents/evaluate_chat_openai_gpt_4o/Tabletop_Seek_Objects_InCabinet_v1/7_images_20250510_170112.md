# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-InCabinet-v1 (7 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the drawer
Step 2: pick the plate and put it on the marker
Step 3: open the cabinet door
Step 4: pick the apple and put it on the plate
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pick the apple to the marker
Step 3: put the fork on the plate
Step 4: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 57/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits two key steps from the ground-truth plan: "open the drawer" and "pick the plate and put it on the marker." Without these steps, the task goal of arranging the apple on the plate is incomplete.  
  
  - **Correctness**: The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan is not logically aligned with the task goal. Specifically, placing the apple on the marker (Step 2) instead of on the plate contradicts the intent of "pick the apple and put it on the plate" in the ground-truth plan. Furthermore, "put the fork on the plate" (Step 3) does not align with the defined task and adds extraneous actions. Closing the cabinet door (Step 4) prematurely might hinder subsequent actions.  
  
  - **Clarity**: The steps are described clearly and in low-level executor-compatible language, meeting the format requirements. However, clear instructions alone cannot compensate for omissions or logical errors in execution
