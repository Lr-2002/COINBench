## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 75/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 73/100

## Justification
**  
  **Completeness:** The model-generated plan covers most tasks but fails to complete the original goal correctly. Importantly, it neglects placing the apple on the plate, a critical step in the ground-truth plan. This omission results in a deduction for completeness.  
  **Correctness:** The model-generated plan rearranges essential actions in a logically flawed sequence. For example, the apple is placed on the marker instead of the plate, violating the task's ordering dependency. Moreover, closing the cabinet door at the end is unnecessary and not specified in the ground truth.  
  **Clarity:** The instructions in the model-generated plan are clear and interpretable by a low-level executor (e.g., "open the cabinet door," "pick the apple to the marker," etc.). All steps adhere to the <action> the <object> format and are unambiguous, earning a high score for clarity
