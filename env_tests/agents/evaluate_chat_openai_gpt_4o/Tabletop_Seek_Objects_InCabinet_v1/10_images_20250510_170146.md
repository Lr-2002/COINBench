# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-InCabinet-v1 (10 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the drawer
Step 2: pick the plate and put it on the marker
Step 3: open the cabinet door
Step 4: pick the apple and put it on the plate
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick the apple to the marker
Step 2: put the fork on the plate
Step 3: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan lacks completeness, leaving out essential steps necessary to fulfill the task goal. It also demonstrates logical errors in sequencing and introduces extraneous actions not relevant to the task. While the steps are syntactically clear for execution, the plan fails to communicate the intended objective properly due to its deviations from the ground-truth plan

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness:** 50/100  
  The model-generated plan omits several key steps crucial to achieving the task goal, such as opening the drawer, picking the plate and placing it on the marker, and opening the cabinet door. It also skips placing the apple on the plate as given in the ground-truth plan. While it does include actions related to handling the apple and the plate, it fails to encompass the entire task goal.

- **Correctness:** 40/100  
  The sequence of steps is logically flawed. Picking the apple and placing it directly on the marker (Step 1) conflicts with the ground-truth goal of placing the apple on the plate. Additionally, Step 2 ("put the fork on the plate") introduces an action which is not part of the original task goal or the context. Step 3 ("close the cabinet door") is misplaced, as the cabinet door is never explicitly opened in the model-generated plan, leaving this action out of sequence.

- **Clarity:** 70/100  
  The model-generated plan is described in a format that the low-level executor can follow, and the individual steps are clearly understandable. However, the deviation from the intended task goal and incorrect ordering causes confusion about the purpose and final objective of the plan.

- **Mean Score:** 53/100  

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan lacks completeness, leaving out essential steps necessary to fulfill the task goal. It also demonstrates logical errors in sequencing and introduces extraneous actions not relevant to the task. While the steps are syntactically clear for execution, the plan fails to communicate the intended objective properly due to its deviations from the ground-truth plan.
