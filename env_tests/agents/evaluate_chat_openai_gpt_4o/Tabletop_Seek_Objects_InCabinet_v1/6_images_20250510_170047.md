# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-InCabinet-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the drawer
Step 2: pick the plate and put it on the marker
Step 3: open the cabinet door
Step 4: pick the apple and put it on the plate
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: find and pick the plate from the cabinet and put it on the table
Step 3: pick the apple to the marker
Step 4: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan is clear and understandable but lacks accuracy and completeness due to incorrect assumptions about object placement and the omission of critical steps in the task (opening the drawer and placing the plate on the marker). The average score reflects these shortcomings while acknowledging the plan's clarity

### Evaluation of Model-Generated Plan:

#### Completeness: 60/100  
The model-generated plan misses an essential action in the ground-truth plan: opening the drawer and retrieving the plate from it. Instead, it incorrectly assumes that the plate is located in the cabinet. The plan also fails to put the plate on the marker, as required in the ground truth. These omissions make the plan incomplete relative to the task goal.

#### Correctness: 70/100  
While the sequence of actions seems logical under the assumption that the plate is in the cabinet instead of in the drawer, this assumption is false according to the ground truth. Additionally, the plan skips opening the drawer, leading to a deviation in object location. The action sequence related to the apple ("pick the apple to the marker") is correct relative to the final goal but ignores the part about placing the apple on the plate.

#### Clarity: 80/100  
The description of each action in the model-generated plan is clear and adheres to the instruction format suitable for the low-level executor. However, the action "find and pick the plate and put it on the table" introduces ambiguity and deviates from the expected low-level command structure (e.g., "pick the plate and put it on the marker").

#### Mean Score: 70/100  

#### Justification:  
The model-generated plan is clear and understandable but lacks accuracy and completeness due to incorrect assumptions about object placement and the omission of critical steps in the task (opening the drawer and placing the plate on the marker). The average score reflects these shortcomings while acknowledging the plan's clarity.
