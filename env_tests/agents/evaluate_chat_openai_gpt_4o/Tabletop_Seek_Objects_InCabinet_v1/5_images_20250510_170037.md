# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-InCabinet-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the drawer
Step 2: pick the plate and put it on the marker
Step 3: open the cabinet door
Step 4: pick the apple and put it on the plate
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: find and pick the apple from the cabinet and put it on the marker
Step 3: find and pick the plate from the cabinet and put it on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 72/100

## Justification
- **Completeness (70)**: The model-generated plan misses the step to "open the drawer" before accessing objects stored there (e.g., the plate). While the final task goal of arranging the objects on the marker can be achieved indirectly, missing this step makes the plan less complete compared to the ground-truth plan.  
  - **Correctness (60)**: The sequence is partially incorrect. For instance, "open the cabinet door" comes first in the model plan, which prematurely focuses on the cabinet before addressing the drawer. Additionally, the model improperly places both the apple and plate on the marker instead of arranging the plate and apple in their required positions (apple on the plate). This changes the task's logical order and intention.  
  - **Clarity (85)**: The model-generated instructions are easy to understand and adhere to the low-level executor's format (e.g., actions and objects are clearly specified). However, the clarity is slightly impacted due to errors in logical sequencing as described above
