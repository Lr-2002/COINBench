# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-InCabinet-v1 (8 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the drawer
Step 2: pick the plate and put it on the marker
Step 3: open the cabinet door
Step 4: pick the apple and put it on the plate
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick the apple to the marker
Step 2: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
**  
  1. **Completeness:** The model-generated plan omits essential steps such as opening the drawer, picking the plate to place on the marker, and opening the cabinet door before accessing the apple. These steps are critical for achieving the task goal fully, and thus the score is significantly penalized.  
  2. **Correctness:** The sequence of steps provided by the model-generated plan is logically flawed. "Pick the apple to the marker" assumes the cabinet door is already open, which contradicts the fact that it remains closed. Also, "close the cabinet door" is unnecessary after moving the apple if the task goal explicitly ends after apple placement on the plate.  
  3. **Clarity:** Despite the logical issues and omissions, the model-generated steps are individually described in a clear and executor-friendly way, adhering to the low-level format ("pick the apple to the marker", "close the cabinet door"). However, clarity is slightly reduced due to the lack of context connecting these steps to the broader task goal
