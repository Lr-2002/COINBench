# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-InCabinet-v1 (9 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the drawer
Step 2: pick the plate and put it on the marker
Step 3: open the cabinet door
Step 4: pick the apple and put it on the plate
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: pick the apple to the marker
Step 2: search for the plate inside the cabinet
Step 3: pick up the plate and put it on the marker
Step 4: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 75/100
- Correctness: 50/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 68/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits the essential first step of opening the drawer to search for objects inside it. Furthermore, while it mentions searching for the plate in the cabinet, it does not first open the cabinet door, which is a required action as per the task setup. Thus, the steps necessary for completing the task fully are not included. 
  - **Correctness**: The sequencing of steps is logically flawed. For instance, the model directs the robot to "pick the apple to the marker" in the very first step, but this assumes the apple is visible and accessible without prior actions to make it so (e.g., opening the drawer or the cabinet door). Additionally, "close the cabinet door" should occur after all required objects have been retrieved and used, but the generated plan includes this prematurely. 
  - **Clarity**: The steps described in the model-generated plan are mostly clear and follow the expected low-level executor format. However, "search for the plate inside the cabinet" deviates slightly from the restricted format and does not specify necessary actions (e.g., opening the cabinet door). Still, the instructions are interpretable with minimal ambiguity
