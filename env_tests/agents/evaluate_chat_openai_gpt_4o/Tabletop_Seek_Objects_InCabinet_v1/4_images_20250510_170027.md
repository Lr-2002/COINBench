# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-InCabinet-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the drawer
Step 2: pick the plate and put it on the marker
Step 3: open the cabinet door
Step 4: pick the apple and put it on the plate
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: pick the plate and put it on the marker
Step 3: search for the apple inside the cabinet
Step 4: pick the apple and put it on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 73/100

## Justification
The plan fails to fully match the ground-truth in terms of completeness (missing drawer interaction and incorrect apple placement), and its sequence deviates from the logically correct flow. Despite these issues, the clarity of the steps remains high, ensuring low-level executors would understand the instructions

## Raw GPT Response
```
- Completeness: **70/100**  
  The model-generated plan includes most of the essential steps for the task goal but omits interacting with the drawer (opening it). Additionally, it places the apple directly onto the marker instead of on the plate, which is specified in the ground-truth plan.  

- Correctness: **60/100**  
  The order of actions is partially logical but diverges from the required sequence. Starting by opening the cabinet door instead of the drawer and later searching for the apple breaks the expected flow relative to the ground-truth plan. The "pick the apple and put it on the marker" deviates from the goal (placing the apple on the plate).  

- Clarity: **90/100**  
  The steps are described in a clear and understandable way, adhering to the required low-level executor format. Each step is individually well-described and executable.  

- Mean Score: **73.33/100**

- Justification:  
  The plan fails to fully match the ground-truth in terms of completeness (missing drawer interaction and incorrect apple placement), and its sequence deviates from the logically correct flow. Despite these issues, the clarity of the steps remains high, ensuring low-level executors would understand the instructions.
