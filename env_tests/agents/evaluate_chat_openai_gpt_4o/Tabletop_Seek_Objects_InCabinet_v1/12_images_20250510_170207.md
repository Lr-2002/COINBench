# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-InCabinet-v1 (12 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the drawer
Step 2: pick the plate and put it on the marker
Step 3: open the cabinet door
Step 4: pick the apple and put it on the plate
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: find and pick the apple from the cabinet and put it on the table
Step 3: find and pick the plate from the cabinet and put it on the table
Step 4: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 63/100

## Justification
1. **Completeness (50)**:  
   The model-generated plan misses a key step in the ground-truth sequence, i.e., placing the apple *on the plate*, which is a crucial part of the task goal. Placing the objects on the table deviates from the objective of correctly arranging them. Additionally, the ground-truth plan involves interaction with the drawer (opening it to access objects); this action is entirely omitted from the model plan.

### Justification:
1. **Completeness (50)**:  
   The model-generated plan misses a key step in the ground-truth sequence, i.e., placing the apple *on the plate*, which is a crucial part of the task goal. Placing the objects on the table deviates from the objective of correctly arranging them. Additionally, the ground-truth plan involves interaction with the drawer (opening it to access objects); this action is entirely omitted from the model plan.

2. **Correctness (60)**:
   The steps in the model-generated plan exhibit logical progression in the sequence of actions, starting with opening the cabinet door and proceeding to pick/place objects before closing the cabinet. However, there are meaningful deviations. For example, the model skips selecting objects from a drawer, and its object placements don't fully align with the task goal. The incorrect placement (table vs. plate) further detracts from the sequential validity of the steps.

3. **Clarity (80)**:  
   The model-generated instructions are clearly described and understandable for a low-level executor. Actions like "open the cabinet door" and "pick the apple" are well-specified. However, "find and pick" introduces slight ambiguity, as the low-level executor may not handle search actions independently. This reduces clarity but not significantly since the steps are otherwise interpretable.

Overall, the model improves on clarity but sacrifices completeness and correctness, adversely affecting the achievement of the desired goal.
