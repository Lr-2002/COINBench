# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-InCabinet-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the drawer
Step 2: pick the plate and put it on the marker
Step 3: open the cabinet door
Step 4: pick the apple and put it on the plate
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: find the apple in the cabinet
Step 3: pick the apple to the marker
Step 4: find the plate in the cabinet
Step 5: put the fork on the plate
Step 6: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 40/100
- Clarity: 70/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan partially fulfills the task goal but misses key steps for achieving the desired outcome. Specifically, it omits the step to pick the plate and put it on the marker before interacting with the apple. Additionally, steps like "put the fork on the plate" and "find the plate in the cabinet" are extraneous and unrelated to the task goal, lowering the completeness score.  
  - **Correctness:** The sequence of actions is logically flawed. The cabinet is opened first without completing the interaction with the drawer (which contains the plate, based on the ground-truth). Moreover, finding and picking the apple without placing it on the plate violates the task goal. The flow of subtasks is incoherent compared to the logical ground-truth sequence.  
  - **Clarity:** The model-generated plan adheres to the low-level executor format and uses clear instructions, but ambiguity arises from the irrelevant steps ("put the fork on the plate" and "find the plate in the cabinet"). Although linguistically clear, these deviations reduce overall clarity
