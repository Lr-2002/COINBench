# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Seek-Objects-InCabinet-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: open the drawer
Step 2: pick the plate and put it on the marker
Step 3: open the cabinet door
Step 4: pick the apple and put it on the plate
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: open the cabinet door
Step 2: find and pick the apple from the cabinet and put it on the marker
Step 3: find and pick the plate from the cabinet and put it on the marker
Step 4: close the cabinet door
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 73/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model fails to fully address the hierarchical relationship between the apple and the plate on the marker, leading to an incomplete task result.
- **Correctness**: The sequence is logical but deviates from the goal's dependencies, and adding the "close the cabinet door" action is unnecessary.
- **Clarity**: The plan's instructions are clear and easily executable, but the slight ambiguity in task framing prevents a perfect score

### Evaluation of Model-Generated Plan

#### **Completeness**
- **Score: 60/100**
  - While the model-generated plan includes picking up the plate and apple (key objects involved in the task), it omits the critical relationship from the ground-truth plan that the apple must be placed **on the plate**. This results in an incomplete execution of the task goal.

#### **Correctness**
- **Score: 70/100**
  - The plan has correct sequential logic for opening the cabinet first and retrieving objects. However, the order deviates from the ground-truth plan by retrieving both items without stacking the apple on the plate (ordering impacts the goal). Additionally, closing the cabinet door at the end is extraneous to the specific task.

#### **Clarity**
- **Score: 90/100**
  - The steps are clear, sequential, and structured using the appropriate low-level executor instructions. Each step is straightforward for interpretation by the robot. However, the mismatch between "apple on the plate" and "apple on the marker" introduces minor ambiguities about the task completion.

#### **Mean Score**
- **Mean Score: 73/100**

#### **Justification**
- **Completeness**: The model fails to fully address the hierarchical relationship between the apple and the plate on the marker, leading to an incomplete task result.
- **Correctness**: The sequence is logical but deviates from the goal's dependencies, and adding the "close the cabinet door" action is unnecessary.
- **Clarity**: The plan's instructions are clear and easily executable, but the slight ambiguity in task framing prevents a perfect score.
