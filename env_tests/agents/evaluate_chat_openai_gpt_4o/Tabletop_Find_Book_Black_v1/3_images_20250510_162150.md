# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Book-Black-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate hand to face forward
Step 2: move around the book to find the black one 
Step 3: pick the book and place it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 80/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 75/100
- Mean Score: 80/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan omits a critical intermediate step required to ensure completeness and clarity for low-level robotic execution, but it remains logically ordered and concise. It assumes the robot's ability to combine multiple actions into a single instruction, which decreases its granularity compared to the ground-truth plan. While it simplifies the overall process, this could hinder execution in situations where precision and explicit instructions are critical

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 80/100**  
The model-generated plan condenses the entire task into a single step, assuming that the robot can automatically locate and identify the black book without explicitly "moving around the book." While it skips over the intermediate step to search for and verify the book's color, this might be achievable depending on the robot's capabilities. However, the omission of explicit instructions for locating the black book detracts from its completeness.

- **Correctness: 85/100**  
The model-generated plan has steps logically ordered, but it oversimplifies the process by combining two distinct actions—finding the black book and placing it on the marker—into one sequence. If the robot's vision capabilities rely on moving around to search effectively, the plan may not fully align with the expected logical sequence.

- **Clarity: 75/100**  
The instruction "find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker" is clear and straightforward but lacks the step-by-step detail that would ensure a low-level executor performs the task correctly. For example, "move around the book to find the black one" is missing, which could improve clarity for the robot to execute the process step by step.

- **Mean Score: 80/100**
