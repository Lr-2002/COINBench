# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Book-Black-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate hand to face forward
Step 2: move around the book to find the black one 
Step 3: pick the book and place it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 80/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan condenses the entire task into one instruction, which improves clarity but compromises completeness by omitting some necessary preparatory steps. While the plan achieves the task's goal, it assumes some implicit understanding or state readiness (e.g., hand positioning, book search process), potentially making it harder to execute in cases where those subtasks haven't been handled

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 70/100**  
The model's plan skips some essential steps described in the ground-truth (e.g., "rotate hand to face forward" and "move around the book to find the black one"). Although it condenses the task into one action, it omits intermediate details that may be necessary for successful execution.

- **Correctness: 80/100**  
The model's plan is logically sound and achieves the task goal directly. However, the lack of intermediate steps—such as orienting the hand and scanning for the black book—may cause issues in execution, particularly if low-level executors need precise guidance.

- **Clarity: 90/100**  
The model-generated instruction is very clear and adheres well to the low-level executor's format. It provides a consolidated action that is interpretable. However, it slightly sacrifices clarity regarding how to locate the black book.

- **Mean Score: 80/100**

- **Justification:**  
The model-generated plan condenses the entire task into one instruction, which improves clarity but compromises completeness by omitting some necessary preparatory steps. While the plan achieves the task's goal, it assumes some implicit understanding or state readiness (e.g., hand positioning, book search process), potentially making it harder to execute in cases where those subtasks haven't been handled.
