# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Book-Black-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate hand to face forward
Step 2: move around the book to find the black one 
Step 3: pick the book and place it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 70/100
- Correctness: 80/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 80/100

## Justification
**Completeness**: The model-generated plan consolidates multiple steps into one ("find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker"), but it skips the essential detail of searching the book on the tabletop and specifically identifying the black book before picking it. This results in missing intermediate actions explicitly outlined in the ground-truth plan.  
  **Correctness**: While the step provided by the model is logically correct and aligns with the task's goal, it lacks sequence details such as rotating the hand forward and explicitly searching for the black book. Nonetheless, the condensed step has logical coherence and doesn't conflict with the goal.  
  **Clarity**: The model-generated instruction is clear and adheres to the low-level executor format ("find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker"). It is concise and straightforward to interpret, earning a high clarity score
