# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Book-Black-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate hand to face forward
Step 2: move around the book to find the black one 
Step 3: pick the book and place it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: find and pick the book from the bookshelf and put it on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 60/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 70/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan omits specific low-level details from the ground-truth plan, such as "rotate hand to face forward" and "move around the book to find the black one." These steps may be critical for ensuring the robot's success in finding the right book under various conditions. While it covers the overall intent of finding and placing the book, it skips potentially necessary sub-actions.  
  - **Correctness**: The model-generated plan is logically correct but oversimplified. The single instruction encapsulates finding, picking, and placing the book, which might make assumptions about the robot's ability to perceive and interact. The sequence appears logical, but the omission of intermediate steps could cause issues in executing the task.  
  - **Clarity**: The model-generated plan is more concise and aligns closely with the robot executor's acceptance of instructions. However, the lack of intermediate low-level actions somewhat detracts from clarity as the robot might struggle if explicit instructions for sub-actions (e.g., moving around the book) are needed. Still, the instruction format itself is clear and understandable
