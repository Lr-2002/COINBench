# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Find-Book-Black-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate hand to face forward
Step 2: move around the book to find the black one 
Step 3: pick the book and place it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: Locate the black book on the bookshelf.
Step 2: Pick the black book from the bookshelf.
Step 3: Place the black book on the marker.
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 85/100

## Justification
**  
The model-generated plan is close to achieving the task goal but falls short of fully aligning with the structure, granularity, and explicitness of the human-annotated ground-truth plan. The omission of "move around the book" reduces completeness and logic, and the clarity could be improved to align better with the low-level executor's needs

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness:** 90/100  
The model-generated plan captures the essential steps of the task (locating the black book, picking it up, and placing it on the marker). However, it misses the explicit instruction to "move around the book to find the black one," which is crucial if the book isn't initially visible or accessible.

- **Correctness:** 85/100  
The sequence of actions in the model-generated plan is logically correct (locate, pick, place). However, the omission of "move around the book" may result in an incomplete search process if the black book is not immediately detectable in the initial view.

- **Clarity:** 80/100  
The generated steps are relatively clear but not as precise as required for the low-level executor. For example, "Locate the black book" is ambiguous for the executor, as it doesnâ€™t specify how to locate it (e.g., move around to search visually). More concrete, low-level instructions consistent with the executor's capability are needed.

- **Mean Score:** 85/100  

- **Justification:**  
The model-generated plan is close to achieving the task goal but falls short of fully aligning with the structure, granularity, and explicitness of the human-annotated ground-truth plan. The omission of "move around the book" reduces completeness and logic, and the clarity could be improved to align better with the low-level executor's needs.
