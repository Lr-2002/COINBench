# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Eraser-FromHolder-v1 (1 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder
Step 2: rotate the hodler
Step 3: pick the holder
Step 4: pick the earser and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: pick up the eraser from the holder
Step 3: place the eraser on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 95/100
- Correctness: 85/100
- Clarity: 90/100
- Mean Score: 90/100

## Justification
The model-generated plan is well-optimized and concise but makes an assumption about the holder's state, potentially skipping an essential step. It is clear and actionable in almost all cases, but minor deviations in phrasing and sequential alignment with the ground-truth plan slightly reduce its scores

## Raw GPT Response
```
- Completeness: **95/100**  
The model-generated plan covers all essential steps to achieve the task goal. However, the ground-truth plan indicates two "rotate the holder" actions, possibly to achieve the correct orientation in incremental steps, while the model assumes a single complete rotation suffices. Despite this, the core steps are included.

- Correctness: **85/100**  
The model-generated plan is mostly logical and sequentially correct. However, there’s a deviation from the ground-truth sequence ("rotate the holder" twice) which might indicate an implicit assumption about the holder’s state that could lead to error. The single "rotate" command assumes that a single rotation is sufficient to align the hole upward, which is not guaranteed by the ground truth.

- Clarity: **90/100**  
The steps are described in a clear and understandable way, and the low-level executor can follow the instructions effectively. The phrasing ("rotate the holder till the hole upward") is concise and task-specific. However, "pick up the eraser from the holder" does not use the exact "<action> the <object>" format (potentially less consistent).

- Mean Score: **90/100**  

- Justification:  
  The model-generated plan is well-optimized and concise but makes an assumption about the holder's state, potentially skipping an essential step. It is clear and actionable in almost all cases, but minor deviations in phrasing and sequential alignment with the ground-truth plan slightly reduce its scores.
