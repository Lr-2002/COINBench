# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Eraser-FromHolder-v1 (4 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder
Step 2: rotate the hodler
Step 3: pick the holder
Step 4: pick the earser and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: pick up the eraser from the holder
Step 3: put the eraser to the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 90/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 92/100

## Justification
**  
  - **Completeness:** The model-generated plan captures all essential actions required for the task but condenses Step 1 and Step 2 from the ground-truth plan into a single instruction "rotate the holder till the hole upward." While this simplification is valid, the explicit separation in the ground truth ensures all necessary rotation states are managed properly. The model assumes the task can be done in fewer rotations, which might omit some finer-grained steps. This slightly reduces completeness.  
  - **Correctness:** The logical sequence of the task is maintained, as rotating the holder, removing the eraser, and placing it on the marker follow the expected order. However, the simplification combines steps that might miss intermediate operations depending on the rotation requirement.  
  - **Clarity:** The model's instructions are easy to understand and are formatted in a way compatible with the low-level executor. The instruction "rotate the holder till the hole upward" simplifies "rotate the holder" repetitively, which enhances clarity without ambiguity
