# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Eraser-FromHolder-v1 (6 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder
Step 2: rotate the hodler
Step 3: pick the holder
Step 4: pick the earser and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 3: pick up the eraser from the holder
Step 4: place the eraser to the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 80/100
- Correctness: 70/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 78/100

## Justification
1. **Completeness**: The model-generated plan captures most of the task requirements but introduces extraneous or unnecessary steps, such as "pick up the cube, put it in the holder," which is unrelated to the goal of retrieving the eraser from the holder. While essential steps for interacting with the eraser and marker components are present, the introduction of unnecessary tasks dilutes completeness by deviating from the objective trajectory.
  
  2. **Correctness**: While the key high-level actions in the model-generated plan adhere to logical progression (e.g., "rotate the holder till the hole upward," "pick up the eraser from the holder"), the inclusion of unrelated subtasks breaks the appropriate sequential flow. The human-annotated plan reflects a more precise and logical order, while the generated one seems to misunderstand the action requirements by incorrectly interspersing additional tasks.
  
  3. **Clarity**: The steps in the model-generated plan are generally clear and actionable, adhering to the format understandable by the low-level executor. However, specific errors, such as introducing irrelevant subtasks, reduce clarity because they may cause confusion about the overarching task context. Nonetheless, individual instructions are descriptive and appropriately formatted for the executor
