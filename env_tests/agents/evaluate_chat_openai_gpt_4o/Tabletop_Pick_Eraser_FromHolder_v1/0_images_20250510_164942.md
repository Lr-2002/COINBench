# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Eraser-FromHolder-v1 (0 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder
Step 2: rotate the hodler
Step 3: pick the holder
Step 4: pick the earser and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 3: pick up the cube, put it on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 50/100
- Correctness: 30/100
- Clarity: 80/100
- Mean Score: 53/100

## Justification
1. **Completeness (50/100):**  
   The model-generated plan does not fully accomplish the task of picking up the eraser and placing it on the marker. While the "rotate the holder till the hole upward" step is relevant, the subsequent actions (handling a cube) are unrelated to the task goal. Additionally, the essential step of picking up the eraser is missing. Therefore, the plan is only partially complete.

### Evaluation:
- **Completeness:** 50/100  
- **Correctness:** 30/100  
- **Clarity:** 80/100  
- **Mean Score:** 53/100  

### Justification:
1. **Completeness (50/100):**  
   The model-generated plan does not fully accomplish the task of picking up the eraser and placing it on the marker. While the "rotate the holder till the hole upward" step is relevant, the subsequent actions (handling a cube) are unrelated to the task goal. Additionally, the essential step of picking up the eraser is missing. Therefore, the plan is only partially complete.

2. **Correctness (30/100):**  
   Only the first step, "rotate the holder till the hole upward," is logically and sequentially correct for the given task. However, the subsequent steps, which involve handling a cube, deviate entirely from the task goal. These steps are logically incorrect for achieving the goal, significantly reducing the correctness score.

3. **Clarity (80/100):**  
   The instructions are clear and well-formatted for the low-level executor. Each step follows the "<action> the <object>" format and is understandable. However, due to the irrelevance of the latter steps, there is a slight penalty in clarity.
