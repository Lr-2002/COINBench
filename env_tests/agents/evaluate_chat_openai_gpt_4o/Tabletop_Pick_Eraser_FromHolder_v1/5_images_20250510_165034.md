# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Eraser-FromHolder-v1 (5 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder
Step 2: rotate the hodler
Step 3: pick the holder
Step 4: pick the earser and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: pick up the eraser from the holder
Step 3: place the eraser on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 85/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 90/100

## Justification
**  
  The model-generated plan is clear and concise, and it logically aligns with the task goal. However, it simplifies the task slightly compared to the ground-truth plan by skipping a potential step (redundant holder rotations), which could be crucial in some scenarios. While this does not strongly impact correctness or execution clarity, it minimally impacts completeness

## Raw GPT Response
```
- **Completeness: 85/100**  
  The model-generated plan covers the essential steps to complete the task, but it skips a sub-step: the redundancy in rotating the holder twice as seen in the ground-truth plan. While this may not always be mandatory depending on the exact physical setup, it does reflect a minor omission compared to the ground-truth.

- **Correctness: 90/100**  
  The steps in the model-generated plan are logically and sequentially correct. The order makes sense, starting with the holder adjustment, extracting the eraser, and then placing it on the marker. However, it simplifies the task without addressing the potential need for iterative rotations of the holder as indicated by the ground-truth.

- **Clarity: 95/100**  
  The instructions are described clearly and are easily interpretable for a low-level executor. Each step follows the required <action> the <object> format and provides sufficient information to execute.

- **Mean Score: 90/100**

- **Justification:**  
  The model-generated plan is clear and concise, and it logically aligns with the task goal. However, it simplifies the task slightly compared to the ground-truth plan by skipping a potential step (redundant holder rotations), which could be crucial in some scenarios. While this does not strongly impact correctness or execution clarity, it minimally impacts completeness.
