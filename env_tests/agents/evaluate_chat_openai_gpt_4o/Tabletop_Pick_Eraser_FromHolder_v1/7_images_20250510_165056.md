# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Eraser-FromHolder-v1 (7 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder
Step 2: rotate the hodler
Step 3: pick the holder
Step 4: pick the earser and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: pick up the cube, put it in the holder
Step 3: pick up the eraser and put it to the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 75/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Clarity: 85/100
- Mean Score: 73/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan captures most of the task but introduces actions (e.g., "pick up the cube, put it in the holder") that are unrelated or unnecessary based on the ground truth. The essential step "rotate the holder" is included but not repeated as expected, indicating partial omission of required repetitions.  
  - **Correctness**: While the sequence starts logically with rotating the holder and ends with handling the eraser, the second step about placing a cube into the holder interrupts the logical task flow and is irrelevant to the task goal. This step compromises the sequential correctness.  
  - **Clarity**: The steps are clearly written and adhere to the <action> the <object> format. Instructions like "rotate the holder till the hole upward" and "pick up the eraser and put it to the marker" are clear and precise, easily understandable to a low-level executor
