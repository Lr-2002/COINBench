# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Eraser-FromHolder-v1 (3 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder
Step 2: rotate the hodler
Step 3: pick the holder
Step 4: pick the earser and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: pick up the eraser from the holder
Step 3: place the eraser to the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 85/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 90/100

## Justification
- **Completeness**: The model-generated plan is mostly complete, but it combines or skips steps that are explicitly listed in the ground-truth plan (e.g., the specific double rotation action to correctly orient the holder may be assumed but is not explicitly mentioned). The skipping of these intermediate details may risk failure in specific setups.  
  - **Correctness**: The steps in the model-generated plan are logically sequenced and make sense. They arrange the eraser-picking task in the correct operational order. The omission of a redundant rotation (if it is not strictly necessary) does not disrupt the sequence logic.  
  - **Clarity**: The model-generated plan is highly clear and conforms to the instruction format ideal for the low-level executor. Phrasing such as "rotate the holder till the hole upward" and "pick up the eraser from the holder" is simple, precise, and actionable.

Overall, while some detail was simplified in the model's plan, the result is a well-structured and effective plan for execution.
