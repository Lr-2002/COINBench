# Plan Evaluation for Tabletop-Pick-Eraser-FromHolder-v1 (2 images)

## Ground Truth Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder
Step 2: rotate the hodler
Step 3: pick the holder
Step 4: pick the earser and put it on the marker
```

## Generated Plan
```
Step 1: rotate the holder till the hole upward
Step 2: pick up the eraser from the holder
Step 3: place the eraser on the marker
```

## Evaluation Results
- Completeness: 85/100
- Correctness: 90/100
- Clarity: 95/100
- Mean Score: 90/100

## Justification
- *Completeness*: The model-generated plan includes most of the essential steps such as rotating the holder, picking the eraser, and placing it on the marker. However, it skips the preliminary step of picking the holder mentioned in the ground-truth plan. This may or may not affect execution depending on task context but deducts slightly for incompleteness.  
   - *Correctness*: The steps in the model-generated plan are logically sequenced and follow a natural order to achieve the task. For example, it ensures the holder is rotated before interacting with the eraser. However, the omission of "pick the holder" might affect sequential correctness in particular scenarios. It is otherwise correct.  
   - *Clarity*: The model-generated plan is clear and adheres well to the action-object format expected by the low-level executor (e.g., "rotate the holder till the hole upward," "pick up the eraser"). Descriptions are concise and informative, earning a high score for clarity
